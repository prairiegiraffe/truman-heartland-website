Every year during January and February, students across our region submit applications through our Scholarship Program that will help shape their futures. This year, nearly <strong>$1 million in scholarships</strong> will be awarded to hundreds of local students.</p><p>Behind every one of those awards is a donor who chose to invest not just in education, but in <i>people</i>. For many fundholders and community partners, creating a scholarship fund has become one of the most meaningful ways to leave a lasting legacy.</p><p><strong>Scholarships: A Legacy You Can See</strong></p><p>Scholarships are powerful because they connect generosity directly to opportunity. They ease financial barriers, open doors to higher education, and often change the trajectory of a student’s life. Long after a gift is made, its impact continues—year after year, student after student.</p><p>Unlike one-time giving, a scholarship fund creates an ongoing story of impact. It reflects your values, honors a loved one, or supports a cause close to your heart, while strengthening our community for generations.</p><p><strong>A Natural Part of Planned Giving</strong></p><p>For many donors, scholarship funds are established through <strong>planned giving</strong>, making them both thoughtful and practical. Two common ways fundholders build scholarships into their legacy plans include:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><strong>Bequests through a will or trust</strong> – A simple way to direct a future gift that establishes or grows a scholarship fund.</li><li><strong>IRA beneficiary designations</strong> – A tax-efficient option that allows retirement assets to support education while preserving other assets for loved ones.</li></ul><p>Planned gifts like these often require no change to your current giving but can create transformational impact in the future.</p><p><strong>How We Help You Build a Scholarship Fund</strong></p><p>At <strong>Truman Heartland Community Foundation</strong>, we make the process of creating a scholarship fund straightforward and highly personal. Our team works closely with donors to:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>Define the purpose and criteria of the scholarship</li><li>Establish and name the fund</li><li>Manage applications, reviews, and award decisions</li><li>Invest the fund for long-term growth</li><li>Ensure scholarships are awarded in perpetuity</li></ul><p>From the first conversation to each annual award, we handle the details—so your legacy remains focused on impact, not administration.</p><p><strong>A Timely Moment to Reflect</strong></p><p>Scholarship season is a powerful reminder of what thoughtful giving can accomplish. As applications come in and awards are prepared, we see firsthand how donor legacies come to life in classrooms, campuses, and careers across our region.</p><p>If education has played a meaningful role in your life—or if you want your legacy to empower future generations—now is an ideal time to explore how a scholarship fund might fit into your long-term plans.</p><p>Our team would be honored to help you create a legacy that lasts, one student at a time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Interested in Creating a Scholarship Legacy?</strong></p><p>If you’d like to explore how a scholarship fund could fit into your long-term charitable plans, we’re here to help. Cole Eason, JD, Vice President of Advancement, works closely with donors and their advisors to design scholarship funds that reflect personal values and create lasting community impact.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">For many Donor Advised Fund (DAF) holders—and those considering opening one—how&nbsp;you give can be just as important as where&nbsp;you give.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>One of the most effective and often underused strategies is donating <strong>appreciated securities</strong>&nbsp;to your DAF instead of giving cash.</p><p>It’s a smart, tax-efficient way to grow your charitable impact while supporting the causes you care about most.</p><h3><strong>What Are Appreciated Securities?</strong></h3><p>Appreciated securities are assets like <strong>stocks, bonds, or mutual funds,</strong>&nbsp;that you have held for more than one year, which have increased in value since you purchased them. If you sell these assets outright, you’ll likely owe <strong>capital gains tax</strong>&nbsp;on the increase in value.</p><p>But when you donate those securities directly to your Donor Advised Fund, the outcome changes— <strong>because you don't realize the capital gains tax!</strong></p><h3><strong>How a DAF Helps You Give Smarter</strong></h3><p>When you contribute appreciated securities directly to your DAF at <strong>Truman Heartland Community Foundation</strong>, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Avoid paying capital gains tax</strong>&nbsp;on the appreciation, <i>AND</i></li><li><strong>Receive a charitable income tax deduction</strong>&nbsp;for the full fair market value of the asset (subject to IRS limits)</li><li><strong>Increase the dollars available for grantmaking</strong>, since more of your asset goes to charity—not taxes</li></ul><p>In short, it’s often possible to give the same value <i>at a lower personal cost</i>, or give <strong>more</strong>&nbsp;to charity using the same asset.</p><h3><strong>Why This Strategy Works So Well with a DAF</strong></h3><p>Donor Advised Funds are uniquely suited for this type of giving. Once appreciated securities are transferred into your DAF:</p><ul><li>The assets can be <strong>liquidated tax-free</strong>&nbsp;inside the fund</li><li>Proceeds are available to <strong>grant immediately or over time</strong></li><li>You retain the flexibility to support multiple charities, on your timeline</li></ul><p>This makes appreciated securities an excellent option for donors who want to be strategic, flexible, and tax-wise—especially around year-end or after a strong investment year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n      <blockquote>\n      <p>This makes appreciated securities an excellent option for donors who want to be strategic, flexible, and tax-wise—especially around year-end or after a strong investment year.</p>\n          </blockquote>\n\n      <div class=\"\">\n      <h3><strong>A Common Example</strong></h3><p>Imagine you hold stock that has grown significantly over time. If you sell it and donate the cash, a portion of that value goes to capital gains tax first. If you instead donate the stock directly to your DAF, <strong>the full value can be used for charitable giving</strong>—maximizing impact with the same asset.</p><p>For many fundholders, this becomes a cornerstone strategy for ongoing philanthropy.</p><h3><strong>Is This Right for You?</strong></h3><p>This approach is especially appealing if you:</p><ul><li>Hold long-term appreciated securities</li><li>Want to rebalance your portfolio</li><li>Are planning a larger charitable gift</li><li>Prefer to give strategically rather than reactively</li></ul><p>As always, donors are encouraged to consult their tax or financial advisor to determine what makes sense for their individual situation.</p><h3><strong>We’re Here to Help</strong></h3><p>Our team works closely with DAF holders and their advisors to make the process seamless—from accepting appreciated assets to aligning your grantmaking with your goals. If you’re curious whether donating securities could enhance your charitable plan, we’re happy to walk through the options.</p><p>Smart giving isn’t about complexity—it’s about using the right tools at the right time to make generosity go further.</p><h3>For Detailed Questions: Contact Cole Eason</h3><p>Please contact Cole at <a href=\"mailto:Eason@thcf.org\">Eason@thcf.org</a> or 816-912-4182.&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

And 1 in 10 households are severely cost-burdened, paying more than 50% of their gross household income for housing.</p><p>We have many young adults in our community who are getting established in their careers and are among these housing-cost-burdened households. Let's, for example, consider college graduates starting their first year of teaching in one of our area school districts. First year teacher salaries in our area districts range from $42,000 to $44,000. So, 30% of the gross monthly income of this teacher making $44,000 is $1,100.</p><p>We have many new apartments in our community, with more being built. Looking out my window from the third floor of the Blue Ridge Bank Building, I can see the Trinity Wood Apartments. Reviewing their website shows a 634 square foot 1-bedroom apartment rents for $1,225.</p><p>This amount, before utilities and renters’ insurance, is already more than 30% of gross income of our new teacher at your child’s or grandchild’s school. And if this teacher wanted a little more space, an 828 sq ft apartment with one bedroom and one bathroom is $1,445 (again not including utilities and insurance).</p><p>We have many other young professionals in our community facing similar challenges, for example police officers, firefighters and nurses. These are people who are serving our community every day, public servants, who cannot afford to live in the communities they serve. I hope most will agree with me that this is a problem, and a challenge we must address as a community.</p><p>Too often, we encounter community resistance when a proposal for “affordable housing” is made. NIMBYism is alive, well, vocal and trending (Not-In-My-Back-Yard). My hope is that more people will recognize the need for housing for our workforce of public servants like teachers, police officers, fire fighters and nurses, and support Affordable/Workforce Housing developments in our communities in the future.</p><p>I ask that you keep this in mind the next time you see a NIMBY post on your social media feed. Let’s work together as a community to address this challenge. &nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

You make a contribution to your fund, receive the charitable tax deduction in the year you give, and then recommend grants to the nonprofits you care about—on your timeline.</p><h3>Why More Donors Are Choosing DAFs</h3><p><br><strong>1. Immediate Tax Benefits</strong><br>You receive a charitable tax deduction when you contribute to your fund—even if you plan to distribute grants over time.</p><p><br><strong>2. Simplicity and Organization</strong><br>Instead of writing multiple checks to different nonprofits, you make one contribution to your DAF and then recommend grants from one place.</p><p><br><strong>3. Flexible Grantmaking</strong><br>Support causes you care about now, later, or over many years.</p><p><br><strong>4. Smart Asset Giving</strong><br>DAFs allow you to give appreciated stock or other non-cash assets.</p><p><br><strong>5. A Lasting Family Legacy</strong><br>Many donors use their DAF to involve children or grandchildren in giving decisions.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>How a DAF Helps You “Give Smart”</h3><p>A DAF isn’t just about convenience—it’s about making your generosity go further.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Is a DAF Right for You?<br>&nbsp;</h3><p>A Donor-Advised Fund may be a great fit if you want to be more intentional about your charitable giving and align your financial planning with your values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Let’s Start the Conversation</strong><br>Contact: Cole Eason, Vice President of Advancement<br><a href=\"mailto:Eason@thcf.org\">Eason@thcf.org</a> | 816-912-4182<br><br>&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Our new record for total grants to hundreds of nonprofit organizations and scholarships to students in our community totally blew the doors off our previous record last year. &nbsp;<strong>The total in 2025 is $18 million compared to $8.4 million in 2024, more than double.&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Grantmaking</strong></h3><p>We had some extraordinary grants made this year - grants of a lifetime - &nbsp;from several of our Donor Advised Funds. Grants from our Donor Advised Funds totaled $10.3 million compared to $4.5 million in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>More than 1,800 separate grants were made from these Donor Advised Funds, and every one of them tells a story about the passion a fundholder has for a nonprofit and their compassion for those served by the organization. &nbsp;The generosity of our Donor Advised Fund holders is truly inspiring.&nbsp;</p><h3>Scholarships</h3><p>We set a new record of $970,000 in scholarships to area students compared to $828,000 in 2024. These 516 scholarships from 175 scholarship funds will enhance the education opportunities of the 392 students who received scholarships.

Their generosity is truly inspiring.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>New Fundholders</strong></h3><p>We are pleased that we added 42 new funds in 2025 and welcome these new members to our foundation family. We also had 6 families join our Heartland Legacy Society by including their charitable fund at the Foundation in their estate plans. It’s our pleasure to work with these families (now totaling 209) to enable them to leave a legacy through their charitable giving.</p><h3><strong>Board of Directors</strong></h3><p>I am also very grateful for the members of our Board of Directors and our 4 Advisory Boards for all their support and efforts this year. These volunteers are crucial to our work, and we could not accomplish our goals without them. At our December Board Meeting, a new 5-Year strategic plan was approved that I will share more about in a future column. It’s an exciting time for your community foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>As we look forward to 2026, I hope that the care and concern that our foundation family has for the community inspires others to be generous. And we can work together to build a stronger community through compassion for our neighbors. Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Here’s why:&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>You’ll lose deductions for gifts below 0.5% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).</li><li>If you’re in the top tax bracket, deductions that count at 37% this year will only be valued at 35% next year.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Neither of these limits apply this year. As Dr. James emphasizes in a recent publication, “If you’ve got flexibility, then pulling charitable gifting into 2025 makes more sense.” By contributing to your DAF before the end of 2025, you lock in the stronger deduction rules and position yourself for even greater giving power later.&nbsp;</p><p>2025 is now the perfect target year for planning a large charitable gift.&nbsp; State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions were recently expanded up to $40,000, and this change applies in 2025,&nbsp; making it easier for more donors to surpass the standard deduction threshold and itemize.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Power of Bunching</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>One of the most effective charitable tax strategies is “bunching,” or grouping several years of charitable gifts into one target year. This allows you to itemize deductions in that year and then use the standard deduction in future years.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, imagine you typically give $10,000 annually over four years but have no other deductions. With a $15,000 standard deduction, those annual donations would not reduce your taxes. However, if you instead bunched all four years of giving—$40,000—into 2025, you could deduct the full amount immediately, then take the standard deduction the following three years. That creates $25,000 in additional deductions that would otherwise be lost.&nbsp;</p><p>Your DAF makes bunching simple. You can move assets into the fund now—capturing the full tax benefit in 2025—while continuing to recommend grants to your favorite charities over time.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Take Action Before Year-End</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Your generosity sustains nonprofits across our community, and your DAF at Truman Heartland Community Foundation makes it easy to act strategically. By contributing into your DAF before December 31st, you preserve the maximum tax benefits available, strengthen your future giving capacity, and ensure your philanthropy continues making a lasting difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, even if you never itemize, you can still receive substantial tax benefits when you give appreciated stock instead of selling it.&nbsp; And if you are itemizing, you get to use the full charitable deduction, too.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Plan Your Next Step</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>As 2025 winds down, the window of opportunity for maximizing your charitable giving is closing, too. Whether through bunching, contributing appreciated stock, or simply adding to your Donor Advised Fund, acting now ensures you capture the strongest tax advantages available before the rules change in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we’re here to help you make the most of this moment. To discuss strategies tailored to your giving, contact <strong>Cole Eason, VP of Advancement, </strong><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org\"><strong>Eason@thcf.org</strong></a><strong>&nbsp; or 816-912-4182 </strong>today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

In 2025, that impact was felt more deeply than ever.

Give Yourself Flexibility in the New Year</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>With a fully funded DAF, you can continue supporting the causes you care about without worrying about timing or added administrative steps.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">As the holiday season approaches, nonprofits across the country are preparing for their most important fundraising window of the year. While year-end giving has always played a critical role in sustaining charitable organizations, 2025 has made this season especially vital.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>With many nonprofits entering the holidays with depleted resources—after responding to heightened community needs and unexpected disruptions earlier this year—<strong>year-end gifts are not just helpful; they are essential</strong> to keeping programs strong and families supported.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>A Critical Season for Nonprofits</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>For many organizations, <strong>November and December account for 30–40% of annual donations</strong>. That’s true in a typical year—but in 2025, the stakes are even higher.&nbsp;</p><p>Economic uncertainty, the temporary pause in SNAP benefits, and rising demand across nearly every area of service have stretched nonprofits thin. Year-end giving is the moment when a donor’s generosity meets an organization’s greatest need, creating extraordinary impact at the exact right time.&nbsp;</p><p>There is still time to make grants from your DAF fund, and you can find <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/news/2025-year-end-giving-deadlines\">End of Year Giving Deadlines here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Power of Holiday Generosity</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>The holidays naturally inspire reflection, gratitude, and giving. People want to make a difference, and nonprofits depend on that spirit to:&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>launch year-end campaigns </li><li>secure corporate matching gifts </li><li>meet urgent needs during winter months </li><li>fund holiday programs and relief efforts&nbsp;</li></ul><p>A single year-end gift often helps organizations do more than donors realize. It may:&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>put meals on the table </li><li>ensure a child receives a warm coat </li><li>support mental health counseling </li><li>help seniors remain safe and independent </li><li>provide shelter to families in crisis&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This season, those needs are more pronounced than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Meeting Goals and Building Stability for 2026</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>For many nonprofits, year-end giving provides the foundation for the <i>entire next year</i>. These final weeks determine whether organizations can:&nbsp;</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>meet their annual budget </li><li>continue offering programs without interruption </li><li>hire or retain essential staff </li><li>respond to the increased community demand expected in early 2026&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Small and mid-sized nonprofits—especially those serving food-insecure households, youth, and vulnerable families—rely heavily on year-end generosity to stay afloat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Making Wishes Come True</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Every donor wants their gift to matter. At year-end, it truly does.&nbsp;</p><p>When a nonprofit can send home weekend food packs… keep their holiday assistance program open a little longer… or meet the last gap in their fundraising goal, <strong>that is the direct result of donor generosity</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>These gifts create hope. They offer stability. And they help nonprofits enter the new year ready to serve—rather than struggling to catch up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>A Season of Impact — and a Call to Support Local Food Pantries</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>This year, the need for food assistance in Eastern Jackson County is unlike anything our community has faced in recent memory. The temporary halt in <strong>SNAP benefits</strong>, combined with <strong>delayed federal worker compensation</strong>, created an immediate and unexpected strain on thousands of households who rely on these resources to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p><p>Local food pantries stepped up—opening their doors wider, extending hours, and distributing more food than ever—but many are now entering the holiday season with <strong>severely depleted shelves</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>As you consider your year-end giving, we encourage you to direct your generosity toward the organizations on the front lines of hunger relief. <strong>Our community food pantries need support now more than ever</strong>, and year-end donations will help them restock, recover, and continue serving families through the winter months.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re unsure where to give, we’ve created a list of <strong>local food pantries across Eastern Jackson County</strong> on our website.&nbsp;</p><p>👉 <strong>Visit&nbsp; </strong><a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/donors/snap-resources\"><strong>https://www.thcf.org/donors/snap-resources</strong></a> to find organizations you can support directly.&nbsp;</p><p>Your gift—no matter the size—puts food on the table for families, seniors, children, and workers caught in this year’s crisis. And it ensures that our community’s most essential safety-net organizations can continue meeting rising needs into 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for making a meaningful difference when it matters most.&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

For some, it’s the importance of kindness or community service. For others, it’s the belief in giving back to the causes that shaped their lives.</p><p><br>Legacy giving — planning a gift in your will, trust, or estate — transforms those values into action. It allows you to continue supporting the nonprofits that reflect your heart, ensuring that your generosity carries forward into the future.</p><h3><strong>A Natural Time to Start the Conversation</strong></h3><p>End-of-year giving often sparks meaningful family discussions about philanthropy and purpose. Including your loved ones in your legacy planning can help them understand what causes matter most to you and why. It also gives you an opportunity to share the stories behind your giving — the experiences and people that inspired you to make a difference.</p><p><br>These conversations can become part of your family’s story, strengthening the connection between your values and the impact you want to leave behind.</p><h3><strong>Simple Ways to Begin</strong></h3><p>You don’t have to have all the answers to start.

Often, new relationships begin as the leaders from these organizations learn more about each other and potentially forge new partnerships.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's also one of my favorite events because of the quiet, underlying power of Legacy Giving. At this event, we have the privilege of honoring the legacy giving of donors who entrusted the Foundation with a gift of a lifetime by creating, through their estate, a competitive grantmaking fund.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Of the $516,672 being awarded, $437,506 is from these legacy gifts.</strong> At the event, we celebrate organizations making an impact today while we honor those who made the grants to these organizations possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our annual competitive grants cycle is truly competitive. <strong>This year we had $1.2 million in requests from 150 organizations. </strong>We greatly appreciate the efforts of our grants committee led by board member Steve Noll. It takes a dedicated group of volunteers to review all the grant proposals and make tough decisions on which ones to fund, given the demand and our limited resources. A big thanks to Steve and the Board Members and Advisory Board Members for their dedication and service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not only are the grants filled by endowments, but also by individual donors each year who increase the grant pool. &nbsp;<strong>Of the 150 applicants, the 67 organizations receiving grants requested $571,000, leaving a gap of $134,000 to fully fund their requests</strong>. I am pleased to say that in addition to our endowments, we had 19 Donor Advised Fund Holders and other contributors who responded to our request to fill this gap, for a total of $79,166. We will also be celebrating their generosity at the grants luncheon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another great part about this positive event is the involvement of our youth volunteers.&nbsp;</p><p>Two of our Youth Advisory Council Students, Caleb Scholes from Truman High School and Shannon Montgomery from Lee’s Summit North High School, will be assisting us in announcing grants at the luncheon. They represent the Youth Advisory Council Students from 10 area high schools who assisted the grants committee in their work this summer. They made 18 site visits to potential grantees and provided their evaluation to the committee.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The YAC students also made 3 grants totaling $4,416 from their endowed fund</strong>, which was created by students and has been built up over the years from their own fundraising efforts. That endowed fund now is more than $130,000. What an achievement to celebrate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you can see, our Grants Luncheon on November 13<sup>th</sup> will bring a lot of positive energy and we will be “Improving Our Communities One Grant at a Time.” Thank you to our presenting sponsor, Insperity.</p><figure class=\"image image-style-align-center\"><img style=\"aspect-ratio:750/799;\" src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2025-Nov/_largeBodyImage/yh09hUTfzw.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"799\" alt=\"\"></figure>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

But what happens 20, 40, or even 75 years down the road?</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Needs evolve, organizations change, and new challenges emerge in our communities. That’s where <strong>Field of Interest Funds</strong> come in — a smart, flexible option that keeps your charitable vision alive while adapting to the future.</p><h3>What Is a Field of Interest Fund?</h3><p>A <strong>Field of Interest Fund</strong> allows you to designate your support toward a broad area of need — such as education, health, the arts, animal welfare, or youth services — without tying your gift to one specific nonprofit.</p><p>With this type of fund, you outline your passion, and Truman Heartland Community Foundation ensures your charitable dollars are directed to organizations and initiatives within that field, now and for generations to come.</p><h3>Why Choose a Field of Interest Fund?</h3><h4>🔹 <strong>Future-Proof Flexibility</strong></h4><p>Unlike a restricted gift to one organization, a Field of Interest Fund can adapt over time. If a nonprofit you once supported no longer exists, your fund continues to make an impact in your chosen area.</p><h4>🔹 <strong>Enduring Relevance</strong></h4><p>Your charitable priorities remain clear, but the fund allows for evolving approaches. For example, someone who cares about “education” might see their fund support early literacy programs today and innovative workforce training decades from now.</p><h4>🔹 <strong>A Lasting Legacy</strong></h4><p>Field of Interest Funds are permanently endowed, meaning the principal is invested, and annual grants are made in your chosen area forever. Your gift creates ongoing impact long after your lifetime.</p><h4>🔹 <strong>Expert Stewardship</strong></h4><p>Truman Heartland Community Foundation oversees the management and grantmaking of your fund, ensuring that your intent is honored while community needs are met in the most effective way.</p><h3>An Example in Action</h3><p>Imagine a donor passionate about addressing <strong>hunger in Eastern Jackson County</strong>. By establishing a Field of Interest Fund focused on food security, their legacy could support food pantries today, nutrition education programs tomorrow, and innovative food distribution models decades into the future — always aligning with the donor’s vision, but never locked into just one organization or approach.</p><h3>Why Now?</h3><p>In times of uncertainty — whether due to shifts in government funding, economic pressures, or changing social needs — nonprofits must adapt quickly. By choosing a <strong>Field of Interest Fund</strong>, your gift is built with that same adaptability in mind, ensuring your legacy remains relevant and impactful no matter how the future unfolds.</p><h3>Start a Conversation</h3><p>Whether you’re drafting your first estate plan or updating an existing one, consider the benefits of a Field of Interest Fund. With Truman Heartland Community Foundation, you can design a giving plan that both reflects your values today and anticipates the needs of tomorrow.</p><p>👉 To learn more about Field of Interest Funds and how they can become part of your legacy, contact <strong>Cole Eason, VP of Advancement</strong>, at <a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org\">eason@thcf.org</a> or 816-912-4182.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

With 3.4 million in DAF grants so far in 2025, we are sure to exceed last year’s record.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>If you have made a significant number of grants this year from your DAF at Truman Heartland Community Foundation, you’ll want to plan to make donations back into your fund before the end of the year due to some tax changes that will take effect in 2026.</p><p>As the year draws to a close, donors with a DAF have an important opportunity. By moving charitable dollars into your fund before the end of 2025 instead of waiting, you not only leverage the flexibility of your DAF but also secure the full value of your charitable tax deductions in light of the changes to come. According to charitable giving expert Dr. Russell James, for many donors, both timing and strategy matter more than ever this year.</p><h3><strong>2025 is the Last Chance for Higher-Value Deductions</strong></h3><p>Beginning in 2026, more people will be able to itemize, but itemized charitable deductions will be worth less than they are today. Here’s why:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>You’ll lose deductions for gifts below 0.5% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).</li><li>If you’re in the top tax bracket, deductions that count at 37% this year will only be valued at 35% next year.</li></ul><p>Neither of these limits apply this year. As Dr. James emphasizes in a recent publication, “If you’ve got flexibility, then pulling charitable gifting into 2025 makes more sense.” By contributing to your DAF before the end of 2025, you lock in the stronger deduction rules and position yourself for even greater giving power later.</p><p>2025 is now the perfect target year for planning a large charitable gift.&nbsp; State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions were recently expanded up to $40,000, and this change applies in 2025, &nbsp;making it easier for more donors to surpass the standard deduction threshold and itemize.</p><h3><strong>The Power of Bunching</strong></h3><p>One of the most effective charitable tax strategies is “bunching,” or grouping several years of charitable gifts into one target year. This allows you to itemize deductions in that year and then use the standard deduction in future years.</p><p>For example, imagine you typically give $10,000 annually over four years but have no other deductions. With a $15,000 standard deduction, those annual donations would not reduce your taxes. However, if you instead bunched all four years of giving—$40,000—into 2025, you could deduct the full amount immediately, then take the standard deduction the following three years. That creates $25,000 in additional deductions that would otherwise be lost.</p><p>Your DAF makes bunching simple. You can move assets into the fund now—capturing the full tax benefit in 2025—while continuing to recommend grants to your favorite charities over time.</p><h3><strong>Take Action Before Year-End</strong></h3><p>Your generosity sustains nonprofits across our community, and your DAF at Truman Heartland Community Foundation makes it easy to act strategically. By contributing into your DAF before December 31st, you preserve the maximum tax benefits available, strengthen your future giving capacity, and ensure your philanthropy continues making a lasting difference.</p><p>Remember, even if you never itemize, you can still receive substantial tax benefits when you give appreciated stock instead of selling it.&nbsp; And if you are itemizing, you get to use the full charitable deduction, too.</p><h3>Plan Your Next Step</h3><p>As 2025 winds down, the window of opportunity for maximizing your charitable giving is closing, too. Whether through bunching, contributing appreciated stock, or simply adding to your Donor Advised Fund, acting now ensures you capture the strongest tax advantages available before the rules change in 2026.</p><p>&nbsp;At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we’re here to help you make the most of this moment.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">There are several new provisions impacting charitable giving in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed in July. For the many charitable people in our community, now is the time to discuss these changes with your financial advisor, your CPA, or other professional advisors, so you can do some planning and give smart.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p><strong>One change in the bill</strong> is that itemized charitable deductions will be worth less next year. The bill reduces the charitable deductions of itemizers by 0.5% of their Adjusted Gross income. So, if your Adjusted Gross Income is $100,000, the first $500 of your charitable deductions cannot be deducted.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you have the flexibility, pulling charitable giving into 2025 makes sense because the same gifts in 2026 will have a smaller charitable deduction. If you have a donor-advised fund, you could contribute before the year-end to your fund and then make grants in 2026.</p><p><strong>A second provision </strong>that impacts charitable giving and is effective for the 2025 tax year is an increase in the cap on State and Local Tax deductions.&nbsp;The cap of $10,000 has been increased, effective this year, to $40,000. So, many more people will again be able to itemize their taxes when their deductions exceed the standard deduction, which is $31,500 for married filing jointly in 2025. In 2018, many households that had previously itemized their deductions found that the State and Local Tax cap and the increased standard deduction meant they were no longer able to itemize.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A third provision </strong>in the bill includes that starting in 2026 there is a new charitable contribution deduction for those taking the standard deduction. For households filing jointly, up to $2,000 in charitable contributions can be deducted on top of the standard deduction. In 2020 and 2021, we temporarily had this deduction, which is sometimes referred to as the Universal Charitable Deduction, but it was capped at $300 in 2020 and $600 in 2021 for married couples filing jointly. The new higher amount is permanent, but unfortunately, it is not indexed to inflation like the standard deduction. And, unfortunately, gifts to donor-advised funds are excluded in this provision.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A fourth point to note</strong> about the bill is that Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) from IRAs are still allowed. There are no new tax provisions regarding this, so just a reminder that if you have an IRA and are age 70 ½ or older, making a charitable contribution directly to a charity from your IRA as a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD), is still a very tax wise way to give.&nbsp;</p><p>And when you are 73 or older and have Required Minimum Distributions (RMD), this QCD counts towards the RMD total. This year you can give up to $108,000 from an IRA. The QCD amount is not taxed like other withdrawals that are taxed as ordinary income. Contributions into donor-advised funds are still excluded from receiving a QCD. However, scholarship funds or funds designated for specific charities at a Community Foundation are eligible.&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, with all these new provisions affecting charitable giving, now is the ideal time to consult with your financial advisor, CPA, or other professional advisors to plan and give smart. &nbsp;If you need resources, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@thcf.org\">info@thcf.org</a>, at Truman Heartland Community Foundation and we’ll help you make connections.&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

For those who no longer itemize deductions or are looking to manage their required minimum distributions (RMDs), a QCD can be a highly efficient giving tool.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Is a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD)?</strong></h2><p>A <strong>QCD</strong> is a direct transfer of funds—up to <strong>$100,000 per year per person</strong>—from an <strong>IRA</strong> to a <strong>qualified charitable organization</strong>. These distributions can count toward your <strong>Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)</strong> if you're age 73 or older, and, most importantly, they are <strong>not included in your taxable income</strong>.</p><p>This makes QCDs especially useful for:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>Individuals who no longer itemize deductions</li><li>Those who want to reduce their <strong>adjusted gross income (AGI)</strong></li><li>Donors looking for a <strong>simple way to support charitable causes</strong> while fulfilling IRS requirements</li></ul><p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Who Can Make a QCD?</strong></h2><p>To be eligible, you must:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>Be <strong>at least 70½ years old</strong> at the time of the distribution</li><li>Make the donation from a <strong>traditional IRA</strong> (not a 401(k) or other retirement plan)</li><li>Send the distribution <strong>directly</strong> from the IRA custodian to the qualified charity</li></ul><p><i>Note: While you can begin making QCDs at 70½, the age for starting RMDs is now 73. QCDs made before age 73 won’t count toward RMDs, but they still offer tax benefits.</i></p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why QCDs Are a Smart Strategy</strong></h2><p><strong>✅ Reduces Taxable Income</strong></p><p>Because a QCD is excluded from your taxable income, it <strong>won’t increase your AGI</strong>, which could otherwise affect taxation on Social Security or Medicare premiums.</p><p><strong>✅ Counts Toward RMD</strong></p><p>If you’re 73 or older, a QCD can <strong>satisfy all or part of your RMD</strong>, helping you avoid penalties while giving purposefully.</p><p><strong>✅ No Need to Itemize</strong></p><p>Since the QCD is excluded from income, you receive the full tax benefit <strong>even if you take the standard deduction</strong>—a key advantage for many retirees.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How It Works</strong></h2><p>The process is relatively simple:</p><ol><li>Contact your IRA custodian or administrator</li><li>Request a <strong>direct transfer</strong> to the charity of your choice</li><li>Ensure the check is made payable to the organization—not to you personally</li><li>Notify the nonprofit of the incoming gift for tracking and acknowledgement</li></ol><p>If you want your QCD to count for this year’s taxes, be sure it is <strong>completed by December 31</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A Meaningful Way to Give</strong></h2><p>Beyond the tax benefits, QCDs offer a meaningful opportunity to make a difference. Many donors use QCDs to support organizations that reflect their values—whether it’s addressing hunger, expanding education, supporting the arts, or preserving green spaces.</p><p>At its core, a QCD is more than a financial move—it’s a way to <strong>align your resources with your values</strong> in a thoughtful, tax-efficient manner.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Learn More</strong></h2><p>If you're approaching or past age 70½ and considering your charitable options, a QCD might be worth exploring.

The same principle can be applied to charitable giving.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Whether you're new to philanthropy or have been giving for decades, approaching your charitable efforts with a <strong>portfolio mindset</strong> can help you make a more meaningful and sustained impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Is a Diversified Giving Portfolio?</strong></h2><p>In the context of philanthropy, diversification isn’t about how much you give—it’s about how thoughtfully you spread your support across different causes, time horizons, and organizations.</p><p>Here are a few ways to bring balance and intention to your giving:</p><h3><strong>1. Fund a Range of Issues</strong></h3><p>Supporting a variety of causes—such as education, hunger relief, health care, or the arts—can broaden the reach of your impact. It also gives you the chance to respond to needs across your community or areas of personal importance.</p><h3><strong>2. Blend Immediate and Long-Term Support</strong></h3><p>Some donations might go toward <strong>urgent needs</strong> or <strong>crisis response</strong>, while others might support <strong>ongoing programs</strong> or fund <strong>capacity-building</strong> for nonprofits. This mix helps address both short-term challenges and long-term change.</p><h3><strong>3. Consider Different Types of Organizations</strong></h3><p>Smaller, local nonprofits often operate with lean budgets and deep community ties, while larger organizations may have the infrastructure to scale programs or advocate for systemic change. Including a mix of both offers complementary impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h2><p>A diversified giving approach can enhance not just what you give, but how your gifts are felt by the organizations and communities you support.</p><h3><strong>✔️ Adapt to Changing Needs</strong></h3><p>Communities evolve. By diversifying, your giving can stay responsive—whether it’s a new need that arises or a longstanding issue that demands renewed focus.</p><h3><strong>✔️ Reduce Risk</strong></h3><p>Just as in investing, relying on a single strategy—or supporting only one type of nonprofit—can limit your effectiveness. A varied approach helps ensure your giving continues to make a difference even if circumstances shift.</p><h3><strong>✔️ Reflect Your Full Values</strong></h3><p>Most donors care about more than one issue. A giving strategy that spans different causes allows you to align your philanthropy more fully with your values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Getting Started with a More Strategic Approach</h2><p>If you're interested in broadening your giving in intentional ways, here are a few steps that can help:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><strong>Reflect on Your Interests</strong> – What causes resonate with you most? Where have you given in the past, and what areas are missing from your giving story?</li><li><strong>Review Past Donations</strong> – A simple glance at past contributions can provide insights. Are there opportunities to add depth or variety?</li><li><strong>Talk with Trusted Advisors</strong> – Whether it's a financial advisor, attorney, or community foundation staff member, these professionals can help you think through your philanthropic goals and explore ways to structure your giving for impact and flexibility.</li></ul><h2><strong>Purposeful Giving Is Smart Giving</strong></h2><p>Thoughtful grantmaking isn’t just about writing checks—it’s about crafting a giving plan that reflects your values, adapts to change, and supports a healthy mix of organizations and needs. Like a well-balanced investment portfolio, a diversified giving strategy helps create a more resilient, purpose-driven legacy.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

And the best part? It’s simple, flexible, and doesn’t require rewriting your will.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why Retirement Assets Are Ideal for Charitable Giving</strong></h2><p>Most retirement accounts—like traditional IRAs, 401(k)s, and 403(b)s—are <strong>tax-deferred</strong>, meaning income tax is paid by the account owner or their heirs when the funds are withdrawn.</p><p>When these accounts are left to individuals:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>Heirs must pay <strong>ordinary income tax</strong> on the withdrawals</li><li>Under the <strong>SECURE Act</strong>, non-spouse beneficiaries are now required to <strong>withdraw all funds within 10 years</strong>, potentially increasing their tax burden</li></ul><p>But when retirement assets are left to a <strong>qualified charity</strong>, like a fund at Truman Heartland Community Foundation:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><strong>No income tax</strong> is owed on the transferred amount</li><li>The full value of the account can be used to <strong>support charitable work</strong></li><li>You may also reduce the size of your taxable estate</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How It Works: A Simple, Impactful Step</strong></h2><p>Designating a fund at Truman Heartland as a beneficiary of your retirement account is straightforward:</p><ol><li><strong>Request a beneficiary designation form</strong> from your IRA, 401(k), or plan provider (or log into your online account)</li><li>Name your <strong>THCF fund</strong> as the beneficiary (either full or partial)</li><li>Let THCF know your intentions so your gift can be used in the way you envision—whether for a favorite nonprofit, field of interest, or scholarship</li></ol><p>You don’t need to change your will or trust, and you can update your beneficiary designations at any time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Benefits of Naming a Fund as a Beneficiary</strong></h2><h3><strong>✔️ Tax Efficiency</strong></h3><p>Charitable organizations do not pay income tax, so 100% of your gift goes to support the causes you care about—<strong>instead of being reduced by taxes</strong> if left to heirs.</p><h3><strong>✔️ Flexible Legacy Planning</strong></h3><p>You can support a <strong>variety of causes</strong> through one fund, create a <strong>named endowment</strong>, or even establish a <strong>scholarship</strong> in your family’s honor.</p><h3><strong>✔️ Easy to Set Up or Change</strong></h3><p>Beneficiary designations are among the <strong>simplest ways to plan a legacy gift</strong>—and can be updated without a lawyer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Real-Life Legacy in Action</strong></h2><p>Many donors at Truman Heartland have already chosen this path. Some have:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>Created funds to support <strong>multiple nonprofits</strong> long into the future</li><li>Honored loved ones through <strong>memorial scholarships</strong></li><li>Supported <strong>local causes</strong> tied to education, the arts, or social services</li></ul><p>These thoughtful gifts, often made with a single form, have gone on to <strong>create meaningful, lasting impact</strong> across Eastern Jackson County and beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>A Legacy That Reflects Your Values</strong></h2><p>Designating a fund at THCF as the beneficiary of your retirement account is a <strong>low-effort, high-impact way to support your community</strong> and extend your legacy for years to come.</p><p>If you're considering legacy giving, your IRA or retirement plan can be one of the <strong>smartest tools in your toolkit</strong>—for both tax reasons and community impact.</p><p>Want to explore how your retirement assets could support the causes you love?

We have new teachers, nurses, police officers, and other public servants who are unable to afford housing in the community they serve. We know this is not a local issue but one common to most communities in the United States; however, we believe the solution to this challenge will be local.</p><p>One new tool that we have created to address this challenge is our “Community First Loan Fund”. This fund, valued at approximately $900,000, is available for projects that address the affordable housing challenge in our community. It’s available for both nonprofits and private companies. We recently made our first loan from this fund to Truman Heritage Habitat for Humanity. They are rehabbing a house that was donated to them in Raytown, and we are providing a short-term construction loan that will be repaid when they sell the newly renovated home. &nbsp;</p><p>This new tool is what is often referred to as “Mission Related Investing”.&nbsp; Yes, it’s an investment of the foundation, and it helps us achieve our mission of “Improving Area Communities”. We are utilizing funds that came from our endowed funds, which provide the revenue for our annual competitive community grants process.</p><p>&nbsp;This money that was previously invested in our fixed income pool on Wall Street, is now invested here locally, on Main Street. This investment does not decrease the amount available for our annual competitive community grants program; it simply changes the source of revenue.&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to making additional loans for affordable housing projects in our Eastern Jackson County community. If you know of someone working on an affordable housing project that I should talk with, please let me know or have them contact me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I will share other aspects of our Affordable Housing Initiative in future articles. It’s a big challenge that will require multiple strategies and tools to make an impact, and our “Community First Loan Fund” is just one essential tool.

But there’s a lesser-known, highly effective option: using a life insurance policy to create a charitable legacy.</p><h3><strong>How It Works</strong></h3><p>A life insurance policy can become a powerful giving tool by naming a charitable organization as the beneficiary, either in part or in full. This can be an existing policy you no longer need for its original purpose or a new policy taken out specifically for charitable giving.</p><p>There are typically two ways to do this:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><strong>Beneficiary Designation:</strong> You can name a charity as the beneficiary while keeping ownership of the policy. This provides flexibility—you can change beneficiaries if your wishes evolve over time.</li><li><strong>Policy Donation:</strong> You can transfer ownership of the policy to a charitable organization. In this case, you may receive an immediate tax deduction for the policy’s value, and if you continue to pay premiums, those payments may also be tax-deductible.</li></ul><h3><strong>Why It’s a Smart Option</strong></h3><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><strong>Big Impact, Small Cost:</strong> Life insurance allows donors to make a much larger gift than they might otherwise be able to contribute during their lifetime.</li><li><strong>Potential Tax Benefits:</strong> Depending on how the policy is gifted, you may receive valuable tax deductions.</li><li><strong>Simple Process:</strong> It’s a straightforward way to establish a legacy—often just a matter of completing a beneficiary designation form.</li><li><strong>Flexible Giving:</strong> You can divide the benefit among family, friends, and charitable causes as you see fit.</li></ul><p>Many people overlook this option, but life insurance can create a legacy that lives on well beyond your lifetime, supporting the causes and communities you care about.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about how to incorporate life insurance into your legacy plan, our team is here to help you explore your options and answer your questions.</p><p><br>📩 <strong>Contact us today</strong> to start the conversation.

This special event offers recipients and fundholders a rare opportunity to connect, share stories, and celebrate educational achievement over a sweet treat, a tradition unique to THCF that underscores the community’s commitment to student success.</p><p>“These scholarships are so much more than financial aid,” said Rachael Cassiday Watkins, Director of Scholarships at THCF. “They are affirmations of hope and belief in the potential of young people. They make higher education possible for many students who may otherwise struggle to afford it, and they connect generations through the shared value of giving back.”</p><p>This year’s impact reflects the generosity and vision behind <strong>175 named scholarship funds</strong>, each established with a unique purpose — whether honoring a loved one, supporting a particular field of study, or helping students from specific schools or communities. Together, these funds made <strong>478 awards</strong> to students attending colleges, universities, and technical schools nationwide.</p><p>The review process was made possible by a dedicated team of 407 Scholarship Reviewers who volunteered to process 2,996 applications. &nbsp;Their thoughtful attention to detail and dedication to fairness ensured that each award was made with care and intention.</p><p>“Year after year, our volunteers show up with incredible commitment,” said Watkins. “They read every story, consider every goal, and weigh each application with compassion.

Some of the most common vehicles include:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><strong>Bequests in a Will or Trust</strong>: One of the simplest ways to make a legacy gift. You can specify a dollar amount or percentage of your estate to go to your fund at THCF.</li><li><strong>Beneficiary Designations</strong>: Easily designate your THCF fund as a beneficiary of retirement plans, IRAs, or life insurance policies.</li><li><strong>Endowed Donor-Advised Funds</strong>: Continue your giving through future generations. You can name successor advisors or designate causes you’d like to support indefinitely.</li><li><strong>Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRTs)</strong> and <strong>Charitable Gift Annuities (CGAs)</strong>: These gifts offer income to you or a loved one now, with remaining funds going to your charitable fund later.</li></ul><h3><strong>Why Consider Legacy Giving?</strong></h3><p>✔️ <strong>Tax Efficiency</strong><br>Legacy gifts may reduce estate taxes, offer current-year income tax deductions, and can help avoid capital gains on appreciated assets.</p><p>✔️ <strong>Enduring Community Impact</strong><br>Your gift becomes part of an enduring solution to local needs — whether through scholarships, nonprofit grants, or community programs.</p><p>✔️ <strong>Customized Planning</strong><br>You can work with our team to ensure your gift is aligned with your values, your financial goals, and the needs of the community.</p><p style=\"text-align:center;\">&nbsp;</p><p>At THCF, we’re here to help you explore your options and find the legacy plan that’s right for you.

On May 15<sup>th</sup> we had our annual graduation picnic for our Youth Advisory Council (YAC).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s always heartwarming to listen to them share their experiences and hear about their heart for service and joy in giving back to the community. The seniors shared their words of advice to those continuing in the program. We also heard from several continuing students who expressed their appreciation to the seniors for their support, friendship, and leadership.&nbsp;</p><p>The slogan for our YAC program, emblazoned on their official t-shirt, is “Empowering students to change their community through philanthropy.” It’s wonderful to see students from 10 high schools in our region coming together to serve the community. Typically, when students from various schools come together, the focus is on competition rather than community building.&nbsp;</p><p>As I shared with the students in my brief welcoming remarks, they truly enable our Community Foundation to do our work better and have a greater impact on the community. One service they provide is reviewing grant applications from our competitive grants process and doing site visits.&nbsp;</p><p>Last summer, they reviewed 16 applications and made site visits and then shared their analysis with our grants committee. The adults on our grants committee consistently provide positive feedback about the students and the information they bring to the discussions. Our YAC students will be busy again this summer reviewing grants and making site visits. So, there is no summer break for our school of philanthropy.</p><p>The students also have the opportunity to make grants from their endowment fund, which they have built up over the years.

CEO Doug Cowan of Community Services League shared the impact of the center, which opened in February 2025 and has already served over 350 visitors. The Drop-In Center offers a range of critical services — from providing meals and hygiene items to assisting with essential documents like IDs and birth certificates, which are often barriers to securing employment and housing.</p><p>Pastor Andreas Stavno, the leader of Good Shepherd Community of Christ, spoke about how hosting the Drop-In Center is a natural extension of the church’s mission of loving your neighbor.

Plans also include creating private office spaces for case management, ensuring that guests receive personalized support in a secure and respectful environment.</p><p>In a show of support, THCF President and CEO Phil Hanson announced a $10,000 gift from the Truman Heartland Community Foundation to CSL, encouraging THCF fundholders to consider joining the effort. “This is a crucial resource for our community,” Phil shared, “and we have an opportunity to support its growth and ensure its success.”</p><h3><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h3><p>As we left the Drop-In Center, our group was inspired by the dedication of CSL’s team, the compassion of Good Shepherd Community of Christ, and the resilience of the guests who are finding hope and stability within its walls.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">There is a great deal of stress amongst the leaders of the local nonprofit sector due to the uncertainty with federal government funding. Let’s take a moment to explore the reasons for that stress and the complex relationship between nonprofits and federal funding.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget issued a memo on January 27, instructing all federal agencies to pause all open grants and loans. This action would have a devastating impact on nonprofits serving our Eastern Jackson County communities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Local Impact of the White House January Memo</h4><p>The memo prompted the staff and board leadership of many local nonprofits to hold emergency meetings and assess the potential crisis for their organizations. Fortunately, after lawsuits were filed in opposition, the memo was rescinded.&nbsp;</p><p>While the level of stress has decreased somewhat, there is still a significant amount of uncertainty for many nonprofits due to the complex relationships between nonprofits and federal funding. Let's explore a few aspects of that relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>First, in my opinion, one of the few things that everyone can agree on is that we are against waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending. It is also my opinion that the federal grants that support local nonprofits in providing services to some of the most vulnerable individuals in our communities are one of the most effective tools for combating waste, fraud, and abuse.&nbsp;</p><p>These organizations are led by individuals from our communities who understand best how to meet the needs within our communities. This is a much better system than someone in Washington, DC, designing these programs. These nonprofits can also generate other charitable local resources to address these needs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Examining the Third Sector</h4><p>The Nonprofit Sector is sometimes referred to as the “Third Sector,” with Private enterprise as the “First Sector” and Government as the “Second Sector.” Let us explore the complex relationship between the Second and Third Sectors.</p>\n    </div>\n\n      <blockquote>\n      <p>\"...charitable giving in 2023 was $557 billion, with 75% coming from individuals or their estates. In 2023 it increased by 1.9%.\n\n To replace the $303 billion in federal funding that is being eliminated now, charitable giving would need to increase by a whopping 54%.\"</p>\n          </blockquote>\n\n      <div class=\"\">\n      <p>A study was done by Candid, a nonprofit that provides data and insights on the social sector, of the 990 tax returns filed by nonprofits for 2023 (the most current data available). This study shows that 30% of the nonprofits filing 990s received government grants, and the total amount of these grants that year was $303 Billion.</p><p>Let’s put this $303 billion in perspective. In fiscal year 2024, Total Federal Government Spending is projected to be $6.8 trillion. Of that total, $303 billion awarded in government grants to nonprofits is just 4.5%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Can Charitable Giving Make Up for the Loss in Federal Funding?</h4><p>Some might suggest that these services are best funded through charitable giving. According to Giving USA, total charitable giving in 2023 was $557 billion, with 75% coming from individuals or their estates. In 2023 it increased by 1.9%. To replace the $303 billion in federal funding that is being eliminated now, charitable giving would need to increase by a whopping 54%.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the anxiety among nonprofits about federal funding is to be expected. Charitable giving simply cannot make up for government grants to nonprofits, even though our country leads the world in charitable giving.&nbsp;</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, in my opinion, grants to nonprofit organizations are one of the most effective tools for combating waste, fraud, and abuse. This is because they are managed and implemented at the local level. I hope we can all maintain this perspective as the changes in federal spending continue to evolve. Let’s not throw the proverbial “baby out with the bathwater.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Truman Heartland Community Foundation</strong> is a public charity committed to improving area communities by promoting and serving private giving for the public good.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">In today’s uncertain climate, future-proofing your mission isn’t just smart—it’s essential. With potential shifts in federal funding on the horizon, many nonprofits are facing new questions about long-term sustainability.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>While no one can predict exactly how policies or priorities may change, what’s clear is that relying solely on traditional funding streams is becoming increasingly risky. That’s where planned giving comes in. These legacy gifts create a more stable, resilient financial foundation that helps your organization stay focused on impact, no matter what tomorrow brings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>What is Planned Giving, Really?</strong></h4><p>Planned giving—also called legacy giving—is when donors commit future gifts through their estate plans. These are often made via a will, trust, beneficiary designation, or even more sophisticated vehicles like charitable gift annuities or charitable remainder trusts. While these gifts may not arrive right away, they offer long-term financial security that allows your organization to dream bigger, plan farther, and weather the unexpected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Why Nonprofits of All Sizes Should Care</strong></h4><p>Whether your nonprofit is large or small, now is the time to start thinking beyond annual fundraising. Planned gifts are typically <strong>larger-than-average donations</strong> and cost significantly less to secure than traditional fundraising methods. In times when government or institutional support may shrink, having a pipeline of future gifts can be the difference between surviving and thriving.</p><p>💡 <i>According to Giving USA, every $1 invested in planned giving brings in nearly $57 in return.</i></p><p>Plus, building a legacy program isn't just about fundraising—it's about deepening donor relationships. These are the supporters who care deeply about your mission and want to see it endure well into the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>How to Start a Planned Giving Conversation with Your Donors</strong></h4><p>The beauty of planned giving is that it taps into something timeless: legacy. Your most loyal supporters already believe in your work. Helping them understand they can leave a lasting impact—even beyond their lifetime—opens an empowering door for them.</p><p>Here’s how to begin:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li><strong>Identify your champions</strong>: Long-time donors, board members, and volunteers are often your best prospects for legacy giving.</li><li><strong>Normalize the conversation</strong>: Add simple language to your donor communications: “Have you considered including [Your Organization] in your estate plan?”</li><li><strong>Share stories of impact</strong>: If you’ve received a planned gift, share that story. If not, highlight a hypothetical example or testimonial from a donor who has made that decision elsewhere.</li></ul><p>This doesn’t have to be a complex or uncomfortable conversation. In fact, many donors appreciate being asked and are looking for ways to make meaningful, lasting contributions—especially in times when the future feels more fragile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Truman Heartland is Here to Help</strong></h4><p>You don’t have to launch your planned giving program alone. At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we work closely with nonprofits across the region to make planned giving simple—for both the organization and the donor.</p><p>Through tools like charitable funds, donor education, and expert guidance, we help your supporters structure gifts that align with their values and ensure long-term support for your mission. Just like the Hope House, the Jackson County Historical Society, and other partners, you can begin building a legacy that withstands change and uncertainty.</p><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4><strong>Ready to Start Your Planned Giving Journey?</strong></h4><p>If recent headlines have left you thinking more seriously about financial resilience, you’re not alone. Building a pipeline of planned gifts can offer peace of mind—for you, your board, and your community.</p><p>👉 <strong>Contact Cole Eason, VP of Advancement, at eason@thcf.org, to learn how Truman Heartland can help make planned giving a pillar of your nonprofit’s sustainability.</strong></p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Each year, the maximum distribution amount is updated in proportion to inflation.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the money goes directly to charity, it doesn’t count as taxable income—which can help reduce your adjusted gross income (AGI), potentially lowering your Medicare premiums and minimizing the tax on Social Security benefits.</p><p>Starting at age 73, the IRS requires you to take minimum distributions from your IRA each year (known as RMDs).

But every now and then, a student’s journey stands out as an extraordinary testament to the power of education, opportunity, and generosity.</p><p>Today, we celebrate Katie Ameku, an Independence, Missouri native, and one of just 32 students in the United States selected as a 2025 Rhodes Scholar—one of the most prestigious academic honors in the world. This remarkable achievement will allow her to study at the University of Oxford in 2025, where she plans to focus on Philosophy, Politics, and Economics.</p><p>While Katie’s hard work and brilliance are what got her there, her ability to access competitive academic opportunities along the way was made possible in part by the generosity of Truman Heartland donors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Investing in Education: The Power of Scholarships</h2><p>Katie received $27,750 in scholarships from Truman Heartland Community Foundation between 2021 and 2024, including awards from:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>The Gene and Joanne Cable Scholarship Fund</li><li>The Sam and Lindsey Porter Scholarship Fund</li><li>The Norman and Mary Anne Davidson Scholarship Fund</li></ul><p>For many students, summers are spent working to cover the cost of tuition. But thanks to these scholarships from Truman Heartland donors, Katie was able to use her summers to pursue advanced research opportunities instead—experiences that set her apart as a top candidate for the Rhodes Scholarship.</p><p>She conducted research at Georgia Tech and the University of Pennsylvania, gaining hands-on experience in X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and computational material science. These summer research opportunities expanded her knowledge, helped her connect with leading scholars in her field, and made her more competitive at a national level.</p><p>\"The scholarships I received from Truman Heartland allowed me to pursue opportunities I never imagined,\" Katie shared. \"Instead of staying back to work, I was able to spend my summers expanding my research, working with amazing academic leaders, and preparing myself for the future. These experiences were truly life-changing, and I am incredibly thankful for the generosity of those who made them possible.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>A Scholar, A Leader, A Public Servant</h2><p>Katie is not only an accomplished scientist but also a dedicated leader and public servant.</p><p>She served as Associate Zone Councilor for the Society of Physics Students, representing five Midwestern states, and has a deep passion for numismatics, specifically researching currencies used in Japanese American Internment Camps.</p><p>Beyond academics, she has also been active in public service, serving on both the Jackson County Democratic Committee and the Missouri Democratic State Committee, where she is the youngest member. Her interest in science policy and communication will play a crucial role in her future studies at Oxford.</p><p>But no matter where her education takes her, Katie remains deeply connected to her hometown of Independence.

With the 2025 standard deduction increasing to $15,000 for individuals and $30,000 for married couples, many donors find they no longer receive additional tax benefits when giving to charity.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>However, by using a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) and a tax-smart strategy called charitable bunching, you can maximize your deductions and make an even greater impact with your giving.</p><h2>What Is Charitable Bunching?</h2><p>Charitable bunching is a strategy where donors \"bunch\" multiple years’ worth of contributions into a single tax year to exceed the standard deduction and qualify for itemized deductions.</p><p>Rather than donating the same amount every year, you can contribute a larger amount every third year to a Donor Advised Fund (DAF). This allows you to itemize your deductions in the contribution year while taking the standard deduction in the off-years.</p><h3>How Does It Work?</h3><p>Let’s say a married couple typically donates $10,000 annually to charity. Under normal tax rules, their deductions might not exceed the new standard deduction of $30,000, so their giving provides no additional tax benefit.</p><p>Instead, using a charitable bunching strategy, they can:</p><ul><li>Triple their donation in a single year, contributing $30,000 to a DAF</li><li>Itemize their deductions that year, significantly lowering taxable income</li><li>Continue to support their favorite charities through grants from their DAF</li><li>Take the standard deduction the next 2 tax years until its time to replenish their DAF</li></ul><h3>Tax Benefits of Charitable Bunching</h3><p>✅ Increase Your Tax Deductions – Every third year, you can itemize and maximize your tax savings.</p><p>✅ Maintain Steady Giving – Your favorite charities continue receiving support each year.</p><p>✅ Maximize Tax-Free Growth – Funds in a DAF can be invested and potentially grow, increasing your giving power.</p><p>✅ Simplify Record-Keeping – Instead of tracking multiple small donations, you handle one major donation every few years.</p><p>For example, under the bunching strategy, donors using a DAF received $18,000 in additional tax deductions every third year—a significant financial advantage.</p><h2>Who Should Consider Charitable Bunching?</h2><p>You may benefit from this strategy if you:</p><ul><li>Typically donate a significant amount annually</li><li>Have itemized deductions that are near or below the standard deduction</li><li>Want to maximize tax savings while continuing to support charities long-term</li></ul><h3>Start Giving Smarter Today</h3><p>At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we help donors strategically maximize their charitable giving through Donor Advised Funds and charitable bunching.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">For many, leaving a legacy means more than passing down wealth—it’s about making a lasting impact on family and the causes that matter most. One of the most tax-efficient ways to do this is through careful IRA beneficiary planning.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>If your IRA or retirement account is a significant part of your estate, it’s important to understand how the SECURE Act and tax laws impact your heirs, and which charitable strategies can help protect your them from unnecessary tax burdens while supporting the causes you care about.</p><h2>The Power of IRA Beneficiary Designations</h2><p>One of the simplest ways to leave a tax-efficient legacy is by naming beneficiaries on your IRA or retirement accounts. Unlike other assets that pass-through probate, IRAs transfer directly to named beneficiaries, avoiding delays.</p><p>However, not all beneficiaries receive equal tax treatment. Since the passage of the SECURE Act, many heirs now face a 10-year payout rule that can significantly increase their tax burden.</p><h2>The SECURE Act and How It Affects Inherited IRAs</h2><p>Before the SECURE Act, an heir who inherited an IRA could take Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) over their lifetime, spreading out taxable withdrawals and reducing their annual tax liability.</p><p>Now, the SECURE Act requires most non-spouse beneficiaries to withdraw the full balance of the inherited IRA within 10 years of the account holder’s passing.</p><h3>Why Is This a Problem?</h3><ol style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"><li>Larger Tax Burdens for Heirs – Instead of spreading distributions over decades, heirs must now withdraw (and pay taxes on) the entire IRA within 10 years. If the inheritance pushes them into a higher tax bracket, they could pay significantly more in taxes.</li><li>Less Control Over the Timing of Withdrawals – Heirs can no longer stretch withdrawals over their lifetime to minimize taxable income.</li><li>Reduced Wealth Transfer Efficiency – More of the IRA is lost to taxes instead of benefiting your heirs or charitable causes.</li></ol><p>This change has many high-net-worth individuals rethinking their estate plans—and for good reason.</p><h2>Why Designating a Charity as an IRA Beneficiary Makes Sense</h2><p>Another highly effective legacy strategy is to leave IRA assets to charity while leaving other assets (such as real estate or taxable brokerage accounts) to family</p><p>Why? Because charities don’t pay income taxes.</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>If heirs inherit an IRA, they must pay ordinary income tax on distributions.</li><li>If a charity inherits the IRA, 100% of the funds can be used for its mission tax-free.</li><li>Heirs can inherit other step-up-in-basis assets (like stocks or real estate), which can be passed down with minimal tax consequences.</li></ul><p>We often find that donors want to support multiple charities through their IRA. This can be done easily through a Donor Advised Fund, which is well-equipped to support multiple charities.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart planning can help ensure that the wealth you worked hard to build is used efficiently—whether supporting family, charity, or both.</p><h2>Leaving a Legacy That Lasts</h2><p>Estate planning is not just about passing down wealth—it’s about aligning your values with your financial legacy. The right IRA beneficiary designations and charitable giving strategies can:</p><p>✅ Reduce taxes on your estate<br>✅ Maximize what your heirs receive<br>✅ Create an enduring charitable impact</p><p>With proper planning, your legacy can extend far beyond your lifetime, ensuring that both your family and the causes you care about continue to thrive.</p><h2>Get Started on Your Legacy Plan Today</h2><p>At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we help donors create customized charitable giving strategies that maximize tax benefits while making a lasting difference. Whether you’re considering a Donor-Advised Fund or a direct IRA beneficiary designation, we can help guide you through the best options.</p><p>📞 Contact Cole Eason today at 816.912.4182 or eason@thcf.org to start planning your legacy.</p><p>Your giving can be smart, strategic, and impactful—for your family and your community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Few exemplify this better than Gene and Joanne Cable, whose impact can be seen across education, healthcare, the arts, and community development.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Their story isn’t just one of giving, but of thoughtful, strategic philanthropy that has created lasting change in Kansas City and beyond.</p><p>While their support extended to many organizations, Truman Heartland Community Foundation (THCF) played a vital role in helping them manage, grow, and maximize their charitable impact. By utilizing a range of philanthropic tools, they built a legacy that continues to benefit future generations.</p><p>This year, as we reflect on the many donors who have shaped our community, we take a special moment to honor Joanne Cable, who passed in 2024, and Gene Cable, who passed away in 2022. Their legacy, built over decades of giving, is a testament to the power of philanthropy done with intention, care, and heart. While they are no longer with us, the impact of their generosity continues through the scholarships, endowments, and community investments they so thoughtfully created.</p><h2>A Life of Hard Work and Purposeful Giving</h2><p>Gene Cable built an automotive empire in Kansas City, founding what would become Cable Dahmer Chevrolet, one of the region’s most successful dealerships. But success in business was only part of his story. He and Joanne believed wealth should be used to lift others up—a value they carried throughout their 72-year marriage.</p><p>They never limited themselves to one cause. Their giving evolved over time, spanning scholarships, healthcare investments, arts funding, and community support. Joanne, deeply involved in local philanthropy, served as a docent at the Truman Library, and played a leadership role in the Junior Service League. Gene, equally committed, never forgot his humble beginnings on a farm in northern Missouri, giving back to Gilman City High School through their FFA chapter.&nbsp;</p><h2>Strategic Giving Through Truman Heartland</h2><p>In 1998, the Cables established a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) at Truman Heartland, recognizing the value of having a trusted partner to help manage their giving. Over the years, THCF helped them identify opportunities, facilitate grants, and ensure their gifts had maximum impact.</p><p>One of their greatest passions was education. In 2011, they established the Gene and Joanne Cable Scholarship, supporting graduating seniors from Truman, William Chrisman, and Van Horn High Schools. Understanding the financial burdens students face, they also provided ongoing scholarship renewals to help recipients complete their degrees. Their commitment to education extended to Longview Community College, where they funded automotive scholarships to support students entering the trade industry.</p><p>But their giving was never limited to just one approach. They used Truman Heartland to facilitate grants, create endowments, and support urgent community needs. Joanne particularly valued how THCF could connect them with causes they might not have known about, allowing them to make both large-scale contributions and smaller, targeted gifts that filled critical funding gaps.</p><h2>Beyond Truman Heartland: A Wide-Ranging Philanthropic Vision</h2><p>While Truman Heartland was an important partner, the Cables’ generosity spanned far beyond a single foundation. They personally invested in healthcare, the arts, and community spaces, ensuring that their giving touched every corner of the region.</p><ul><li><strong>Children’s Healthcare:</strong> Their donations helped bring cutting-edge medical equipment to Eastern Jackson County. They funded an MRI machine for Children’s Mercy East Hospital, and contributed a 3D medical printer to St. Luke’s Cardiatric Center Hospital. Additionally, they created an endowment at Children’s Mercy East to support nursing students.</li><li><strong>The Arts &amp; Music Education:</strong> Joanne was a board member at the Music/Arts Institute in Independence, where the Cables funded scholarships for students and improvements to the building. Additionally, they gave a scholarship to a young man who went through the entirety of the program. When Joanne passed, he attended and played music at her memorial service, and the family was very touched by his performance. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Community Infrastructure:</strong> They didn’t just donate to organizations—they built lasting structures. One of their landmark contributions was funding the construction of a home, on the Drumm Farm Campus to house foster parents and their children.&nbsp; They also gifted a water fountain to Powell Gardens, creating a serene gathering space for visitors.</li><li><strong>Community Development:</strong> Gene was active in the Independence Rotary club all throughout his career. He made contributions to their community projects that helped the CSL, City of Independence and Hope House. He was instrumental in the 1960s and 70’s in putting together the charter for the City of Independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>A Family Legacy That Lives On</h2><p>For Gene and Joanne, philanthropy wasn’t just about writing checks—it was about instilling a deep sense of responsibility in their family. Their daughter, Cindy Cavanah, continued to pursue her own lifestyle of philanthropy and giving back to communities. She has served on the board of Truman Heartland Foundation for 9 years, and the Drumm Farm Center for Children for 20 years, as well as on the Independence Chamber Board. She continues to manage their endowments at Truman Heartland, ensuring that their legacy of giving endures.</p><p>Their mindset every day was focused on generosity, shaping a legacy that is still being written. Through endowments, scholarships, and strategic investments, the Cables have ensured that their wealth will continue to benefit Kansas City for generations to come.</p><h2>An Inspiration for Future Philanthropists</h2><p>Not everyone has the level of resources the Cables did. But their story isn’t just about the amount they gave—it’s about the way they gave. They used Truman Heartland’s tools to make strategic, high-impact donations while also ensuring personal, heartfelt contributions to the causes they cared about most.</p><p>For those looking to leave their own mark, the Cables provide an inspiring example:</p><p>✅ Start with passion—find the causes that matter most to you.</p><p>✅ Use strategic giving tools—partner with organizations like THCF to grow your impact.</p><p>✅ Think long-term—consider endowments and scholarships to create a lasting legacy.</p><p>Though Gene and Joanne are no longer with us, their generosity continues changing lives every day. Their impact is not just measured in dollars, but in the students they empowered, the families they uplifted, and the community they strengthened. Their story serves as a reminder that philanthropy, when done with purpose, can truly shape the future.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs) have become one of the most popular ways to manage charitable giving. With their tax advantages, flexibility, and potential for long-term growth, they offer a convenient way to support the causes you care about.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>But while setting up a DAF is easier than ever—often through national financial institutions—it’s important to ask yourself:</p><p>👉 <strong>Where is my money really going?</strong><br>👉 <strong>Is it making the biggest impact possible?</strong><br>👉 <strong>Does it reflect my values and the needs of my community?</strong></p><p>At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we believe philanthropy should be personal, strategic, and rooted in the communities we call home.&nbsp;</p><p>While national DAF providers can offer convenience, they often lack the local expertise, relationships, and hands-on support that help donors create a meaningful and lasting impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The Growing Popularity of Donor-Advised Funds</strong></h3><p>DAFs are reshaping the culture of philanthropy. With over $250 billion in assets held in these funds nationwide, they provide a powerful way for donors to organize their giving, support multiple charities, and take advantage of tax benefits.</p><p>However, many donors don’t realize that their charitable dollars—when managed by a national DAF provider—may not necessarily benefit the causes or communities closest to their hearts. Instead, funds may remain undistributed for long periods, or they may go to large, well-known national charities rather than addressing critical local needs.</p><p>That’s where a community foundation makes all the difference.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>Why Work with a Community Foundation for Your DAF?</strong></h3><p>At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we offer a more thoughtful and connected approach to philanthropy. Here’s how we help our donors make the most of their charitable giving:</p><h4><strong>1. Deep Local Knowledge for a Greater Impact</strong></h4><p>When you work with a community foundation, you gain access to trusted experts who understand the most pressing needs in your area. Unlike national DAF providers, we are on the ground, working closely with local nonprofits, civic leaders, and organizations that create real, measurable change.</p><p>Instead of simply distributing grants at random, we help connect your passion with purpose, ensuring that your generosity supports causes that align with your values and create meaningful, lasting impact in your own backyard.</p><h4><strong>2. Personalized, Hands-On Philanthropic Support</strong></h4><p>A national DAF provider may offer a platform to manage donations, but they lack the personal touch that makes giving truly rewarding. At Truman Heartland, we provide:</p><ul><li><strong>Personalized philanthropic advising</strong> – We help you create a strategic giving plan based on your goals and interests.</li><li><strong>Grantmaking support</strong> – Need guidance on the best local organizations to support? We do the research for you.</li><li><strong>Legacy planning</strong> – Whether you want to involve future generations in philanthropy or establish an ongoing charitable legacy, we offer expert guidance to ensure your vision lives on.</li></ul><h4><strong>3. Keeping Your Charitable Dollars in Your Community</strong></h4><p>A major drawback of national DAF providers is that your funds could be distributed anywhere in the country—even to causes that don’t directly impact your community.</p><p>At Truman Heartland, we ensure that your generosity stays local, supporting the organizations and initiatives that strengthen the place you call home. When you choose a community foundation, you’re not just giving—you’re investing in your community’s future.</p><h4><strong>4. Responsiveness in Times of Crisis</strong></h4><p>One of the biggest benefits of partnering with a community foundation is our ability to respond quickly when unexpected needs arise. Whether it’s a natural disaster, economic downturn, or urgent social issue, we mobilize resources immediately, ensuring that help reaches those who need it most.</p><p>With a national provider, your funds may sit in an account for years, waiting to be distributed. But at Truman Heartland, we believe in taking action when it matters most.</p><h4><strong>5. All the Benefits of a National DAF—With a Local, Mission-Driven Focus</strong></h4><p>Working with Truman Heartland gives you the same tax benefits, investment growth potential, and flexibility as a national provider—while also ensuring that your funds are actively making a difference in your community.</p><p>You can still contribute a variety of assets, including:<br>✅ Cash and appreciated stock<br>✅ Real estate and business interests<br>✅ Retirement assets and life insurance</p><p>But instead of your funds sitting untouched in a large financial institution, they will be strategically distributed to create meaningful change in the areas you care about most.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Making the Most of Your Donor-Advised Fund</strong></h3><p>As DAFs continue to grow in popularity, they are becoming a mainstream giving tool, much like retirement or college savings accounts. But simply having a DAF isn’t enough—the real power lies in how you use it.</p><p>By partnering with Truman Heartland Community Foundation, you ensure your giving is strategic, impactful, and deeply connected to your community.</p><p>If you already have a DAF with a national provider, it’s never too late to explore ways to maximize its impact locally. We can help you:</p><p><br>✔ Transfer your existing DAF to Truman Heartland<br>✔ Identify high-impact giving opportunities<br>✔ Ensure that your philanthropy aligns with your values and goals</p><h3><strong>Let’s Make a Difference Together</strong></h3><p>At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we believe in thoughtful, community-driven philanthropy. When you choose to work with us, you’re choosing a future where your generosity directly improves lives in your community.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about how we can help you make the most of your Donor-Advised Fund, reach out today. Together, we can create a smarter, more impactful approach to giving—one that keeps your charitable dollars working for the people and places you care about most.</p><p>📍 <strong>Contact:</strong> Cole Eason<br>📧 <strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eason@thcf.org</a><br>📞 <strong>Phone:</strong> (816) 912-4182</p><p>Your generosity has the power to change lives right here at home.

The free Grants Workshop on February 6 will be hosted for nonprofit organizations to help them level up their grant-writing skills, learn how to navigate our grant applications, and make sure they’re positioned to be competitive in this process.&nbsp;</p><p>During the presentation, attendees will be introduced to our two grant programs: the Community Grants Program and the Jelley Family Foundation Endowment for Children’s Education Grants. Additionally, they’ll learn important details about how to navigate our NEW Grants Dashboard, which has had some changes for the 2025 cycle.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure a diverse portfolio of nonprofits being funded, the foundation had a goal last year of allocating 10% of funding to new grantees, and the foundation surpassed that goal by achieving 22%. The foundation will continue to allocate dollars to new grantees in 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>\"We love the opportunity to support a wide range of nonprofit organizations that are making an impact and improving communities.\" Castillo continued, \"supporting critical issues and creating positive change in our Eastern Jackson and Cass Counties communities is extremely important to the foundation.\"</p><p>This workshop is in high demand, and therefore, the foundation requests that only one person per organization register due to limited space. The session will be recorded and made available on the THCF website. Organizations that serve Eastern Jackson County and Cass County and have never received grant funding from THCF in the past are strongly encouraged to attend and apply for funding. However, it is important to note that attendance at this workshop does not impact any organization's ability to receive a THCF competitive grant.&nbsp;</p><p>Registration for our <a href=\"https://thcf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/create/ticket?edt_id=2155\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Grants Workshop February 6</a> is currently open and available!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>More information about the competitive grants program, including eligibility criteria and areas of service, can be found at the foundation's website, <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/grant-seekers\">https://www.thcf.org/grant-seekers</a>, or by contacting the Vice President of Community Impact, Diana Castillo, at (816) 912-4184 or castillo@thcf.org.&nbsp;</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Early settlers in Missouri, the Bush family had a large stock ranch and farms in Carroll County near Norborne, Missouri, a Wood Heights farm in Ray County and a ranch in Jeff Davis County, Texas near Valentine. Mary, the second of three children, inherited parcels of the family farms when her parents passed away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mary passed away in 1960, and when the Bush family farms were sold, Blue Ridge Bank and Trust Co., the administrators of the Axtell Trust, established a scholarship fund with Truman Heartland Community Foundation in 2019. As instructed in Mary’s charitable will and testamentary trust, the scholarship will provide perpetual support for students of Ray and Carroll County.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Phil Hanson, Truman Heartland’s President and CEO, said, “We are honored to carry on Mary Axtell’s legacy and offer students in Ray and Carroll County the opportunity to continue their education.” &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2024, Truman Heartland awarded more than $828,000 in 461 scholarship awards to nearly 340 local students.

Adding to your fund allows you to enjoy the tax benefits of your donation today and continue your giving into the New Year worry-free. Your DAF is a powerful tool that can potentially increase in value over time and provide even more funding for your future grant-making. But you need to make sure you have adequate funds in your account available to invest and grow!</p><p>Review your fund balance on the <a href=\"https://thcf.fcsuite.com/erp/fundmanager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">donor portal</a> or <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/about/contact-us\">contact our office</a>.

For my family the biggest new blessing is our first grandchild, Jacklynn, who will be 1 year old on December 7<sup>th</sup>, so this will be her first Thanksgiving. My wife Nancy and I are enjoying the truly awesome role of grandparents. And we are very thankful that all three of our children are in town and gather most Sundays at our home for dinner which now includes the Jacklynn show, as she is certainly the center of attention. She has her 2 doting aunts and her uncle wrapped around her finger in addition to her grandparents.</p><p>I am also very thankful for all the people my Community Foundation has the privilege of working with to support their charitable giving through their fund here at the Foundation. Last year our total grants and scholarships totaled $7.3 Million, and we are on pace to break that record again due to the generosity of our fundholders. Last year our Donor Advised Fund Holders made grants to charities they support totaling $3.2 Million. Year to date they have already made grants of $3.5 Million as we enter the holiday season which is always a busy grantmaking time. Our scholarships this year also set a new record of $828,000, which will impact the education opportunities of the 334 students who received scholarships.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon the classic Christmas movies will appear on our television screens. My mind goes to “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”, and the iconic line “And what happened then..? Well … in Whoville they say, that the Grinch’s small heart grew three sizes that day”.&nbsp; My heart, that of a new grandparent, has certainly grown a few sizes due to Jacklynn’s addition to our family, as have the hearts of our entire family. But the growth of our hearts is not just impacted by Grandkids. I truly believe charitable giving is another act of love that grows the sizes of hearts. As the Grinch learned, the holiday season is about more than just presents and trimmings-it’s about love, community, and the spirit of the season. The Grinch’s transformation was a shift from bitterness and isolation to joy and connection. My wish for the holiday season is that all our hearts may continue to grow. Happy Holidays!</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

The key benefits of a CRT include:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>Income Stream: The trust generates regular income payments to the donor or beneficiaries, which can be structured as either a fixed annuity (CRAT) or a percentage of the trust's assets (CRUT).</li><li>Tax Advantages: Donors receive an immediate charitable income tax deduction and avoid capital gains taxes on appreciated assets transferred to the trust.</li><li>Estate Planning: Assets in the CRT are excluded from the donor's estate, potentially reducing estate taxes.</li></ul><p><strong>Donor-Advised Fund (DAF)</strong></p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc;\"><li>A DAF acts as a charitable investment account for supporting organizations donors care about. When combined with a CRT, it provides additional flexibility:</li><li>Remainder Beneficiary: Naming a DAF as the remainder beneficiary of a CRT allows donors to defer deciding on specific charities until later, offering adaptability in philanthropic goals.</li><li>Ongoing Family Involvement: Donors' families can continue to recommend grants from the DAF, maintaining involvement in charitable decisions over time.</li><li>Investment Management: The donor's financial advisor can continue to manage the investments within the DAF, ensuring consistent oversight and strategic growth of assets.</li></ul><p><strong>Strategic Benefits</strong></p><p>By coupling a CRT with a DAF, donors gain significant control over their charitable giving. This combination allows them to enjoy lifetime income benefits while planning substantial future gifts. It also simplifies adjustments to charitable designations without costly legal amendments, making it an attractive option for those seeking both financial security and philanthropic impact.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

This surge is often attributed to year-end giving campaigns, holiday generosity, and tax considerations. It is the perfect time of year where an agency’s needs and donor’s needs meet, making a huge impact.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tax Deductions for Donors:&nbsp;</strong>Many donors choose to make charitable contributions at the end of the year to take advantage of tax deductions. In the U.S., donations made by December 31st are eligible for that year’s tax returns. This incentivizes donors to give more during the final months of the year, boosting nonprofit revenue.</p><p><strong>It’s a perfect time for an IRA Charitable Rollover</strong>: Older adults can donate directly from their IRAs, which can count as a required minimum distribution, offering tax advantages while benefiting a cause they care about.</p><p><strong>The Holiday Spirit:</strong> People tend to feel more generous around the holidays, especially as the year draws to a close. There's often a cultural push toward giving, whether it's through gifts, charity drives, or end-of-year campaigns. Nonprofits capitalize on this spirit by running end-of-year fundraising campaigns. Remember,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>many organizations or corporations match their employees’ charitable contributions, and a year-end campaign is the prime time for donors to maximize their giving opportunities and give back more to the charities they care about.</p><p><strong>Tis the season to meet goals and plan for the future:&nbsp;</strong>Nonprofits often have annual financial goals to meet, and year-end giving helps them close the gap between their funding needs and actual contributions. For many organizations, the last quarter of the year can provide the bulk of their funding for the entire year.</p><p>Year-end gifts help nonprofits maintain their programs, plan for the upcoming year, and cover operational expenses. This is especially important for smaller nonprofits that rely heavily on individual donations.</p><p><strong>Answering holiday wishes:&nbsp;</strong>You, as a donor, can make wishes come true. Donors are motivated to give more generously when they know their contribution can meet a critical need or a time-sensitive opportunity.</p><p>For many nonprofits, year-end giving is an essential part of their fundraising strategy, helping them not only to meet financial goals for the year but also to build momentum for the year ahead. It offers nonprofits a chance to connect with donors, celebrate the impact of their work, and create lasting relationships that support their mission, programs, and services.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Maybe you'll take an art class at the community college, spend more time in your garden, or go on that once-in-a-lifetime trip you've been dreaming of.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>While making your plans, have you considered ways to support your favorite causes during retirement? Two options to consider are a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) and giving with an IRA. Both methods offer unique benefits, and understanding their differences can help you make the right decision for your giving legacy.</p><p>A Charitable Remainder Trust allows you to contribute appreciated assets, such as stocks or real estate, to the trust. In return, the trust provides you with a fixed stream of income for a specified period or for the rest of your life. This can be beneficial for generating income during retirement while also allowing you to support charitable causes. By contributing appreciated assets to the trust, you may be able to eliminate capital gains taxes and reduce potential inheritance taxes. The trust is managed by your community foundation or another qualified trustee, which relieves you from administrative responsibilities and allows you to enjoy your retirement while making a meaningful impact</p><p>On the other hand, giving with an IRA involves donating funds directly from your Individual Retirement Account (IRA) to qualified charities. This is called a Qualified Charitable Distribution and if you’re 70 ½ or older you can transfer up to $105,000 to charity and not recognize it as income.&nbsp; This can be a tax-efficient way to support charitable causes during retirement. However, it's important to note that donations from IRAs to charities are ineligible for <a href=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/documents/Donor-Advised-Funds/Right-1-What-is-a-DAF.pdf\">donor advised funds</a> (DAFs), which are philanthropic vehicles that allow donors to recommend grants to charitable organizations over time.</p><p>When deciding between a CRT and giving with an IRA, consider your financial goals, charitable intentions, and estate planning priorities. Each method offers unique benefits, and consulting with financial and legal advisors can help you determine the best approach for your individual circumstances. Ultimately, whether you choose a Charitable Remainder Trust, giving with an IRA, or some other option, your generosity can leave a lasting legacy while providing for your retirement needs.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

It involves using investment funds to generate both financial returns and positive social impact. This means redirecting funds typically invested in traditional markets (on Wall Street) toward local initiatives and projects that aim to address pressing social issues (on Main Street). For your community foundation, that pressing issue in our community is affordable housing. Our local community's lack of affordable housing has the same adverse effects on health, wellness, stability, and prosperity as is documented nationally. The goal is to achieve a tangible and beneficial impact on our community while earning a financial return.</p><p>At the core of mission-related investing, particularly in the context of local affordable housing, is the idea of making a meaningful difference. By channeling investment funds into projects that target key needs and fill financial gaps, we can work towards creating a positive and lasting impact on housing affordability.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to financial support, mission-related investing in local affordable housing offers a unique opportunity to engage with our donors and the public in a different way. It's not just about grants; it's about making strategic investments that will benefit our community in the long run. By providing loans to nonprofit organizations, government entities, and private initiatives focused on addressing housing affordability, we can empower these entities to further their missions and drive positive change in this critical area.</p><p>It's important to emphasize that our commitment to mission-related investing will not diminish the support we provide through our competitive grantmaking activities. We are committed to fulfilling the wishes of our donors who contributed to the competitive grants process and providing our local nonprofits with the necessary grant funding for their essential programs and initiatives.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the objective is clear: to make a genuine and transformative impact through our investments. This is an opportunity for the foundation to create a ripple effect of positive change that extends far beyond traditional grantmaking. We are committed to keeping our fundholder family informed and engaged in this exciting opportunity as we move forward. Mission-related investing represents a new chapter in our efforts to drive positive change in this critical area, and we look forward to sharing our progress and successes with you.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Whether it's through lifelong careers and volunteer work focused on education, like Doug and Helen Hatridge; helping people facing addiction and homelessness realize their worth, like Bobby Himes; or fighting to give a voice to our dishonored and displaced neighbors of color, like Alversia Pettigrew, the event was a night of unity, hope, and a shared vision for a brighter future for all. This year's event was a vibrant display of community spirit and support, with guests coming together from throughout the metro to honor the tireless efforts of those dedicated to uplifting our towns.</p><p>The highlights of the evening were most definitely the recognition of our 2024 <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/gala/citizens-of-the-year\">Citizens of the Year</a>, Craig Bolger as the <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/gala/advisor-of-the-year\">Dr. Paul M.

These honorees were chosen for their significant contributions to the community.&nbsp;</p><p>At the Gala, Phil Hanson, President and CEO, announced a new foundation initiative to address the lack of affordable housing in the communities we serve. This important initiative was born out of extensive needs assessments that revealed the challenges faced by many in accessing affordable housing. The gala provided a platform to shed light on this crucial issue and introduce everyone to the Foundation’s plan to have a positive impact on this important local issue. You can read more about this unique way to address the issue in our article about impact investing.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who couldn't attend the gala, the foundation website offers a wonderful opportunity to experience the festivities from the comfort of your own home or office.

However, it is hard to capture the positive vibe of the evening and the fun and lively atmosphere that filled the ballroom.

Unfortunately, when adjusted for inflation, the total decline was 2.1 percent. This follows a decline of 3.4 percent in 2022 in current dollars, which was a decline of 10.5 percent adjusted for inflation. So, overall, charitable giving in the past two years has not been growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Giving by individuals continues to provide the preponderance of giving. At $374.4 billion, individual giving is 67 percent of the total, and when you add in bequests from individuals, it is 75 percent of the total. Giving by Foundations was 19 percent of the total, and corporations 7 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Giving USA Report includes a relatively new chapter reporting on giving by and to donor advised funds (DAFs). The report indicates that grants made from DAFs in 2022 totaled $52.16 Billion, an increase of 9.1 percent over the preceding year. During this same time, the approximately 300 donor advised funds here at your Community Foundation increased grants by 20 percent to $3.2 Million in 2022. Donor Advised Fund Giving is one of the most positive trends in charitable giving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A study was also done for the first time, “The 2024 DAF Fundraising Report-The Inaugural Benchmark Study on Nonprofit Fundraising from Donor Advised Funds”. The study utilized data from 20 larger nonprofits with 34,498 donors who gave to them via their DAF. A key finding from the study was that once donors began giving via their DAF, their giving to the organization increased, on average, 96 percent. For example, if a donor had given a $1,000 gift by credit card previously, their gift from their DAF would be nearly $2,000 per year after.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some people criticize DAFs as a way for the wealthy to get an immediate tax deduction but not have to make an immediate grant from their fund to their charities of choice. They often characterize this as hoarding their charitable giving. Organizations like your Community Foundation, which work with community members who have DAFs, realize that DAFs are to charitable giving what 401(k)s are to retirement or Health Savings Accounts are to healthcare expenses. They are dedicated sources for charitable giving, and as this study found, having this dedicated source enhances the generosity of donors. Again, donor advised fund giving is one of the most positive trends in charitable giving.

Understanding these trends helps us adapt and adjust our strategies to meet the evolving needs and preferences of our generous donors and the communities we serve.</p><ul><li><strong>Individual Giving Continues to Lead:&nbsp;</strong>Historically, individual donors have been the primary drivers of charitable giving in the United States, and this trend remains strong. &nbsp;According to Giving USA, in 2023, individual giving was 67% of the total giving ($374 billion from individuals of &nbsp;$557 billion in total). The generosity of individual donors, especially the very wealthy, continues to play a significant role in shaping the philanthropic landscape. But that’s not to discount smaller, regular donors, who remain the financial backbone of many nonprofits.</li><li><strong>Rise of Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs):</strong> Over the past few years, the popularity of donor advised funds has surged. According to data from the National Philanthropic Trust, the number of DAFs in the US increased by 2.9 percent from 2021 to 2022, reaching an estimated 1,771,844 accounts. Giving USA estimates that more than $52 billion in grants are made from DAFs each year. This trend has implications for your community foundations as we collaborate with a wide range of donors who utilize their DAF as a strategic charitable giving tool. More than 25 percent of the charitable funds held at THCF are DAFs, and that number continues to rise steadily as more and more people learn about the benefits of utilizing a DAF for their personal giving.</li><li><strong>Shifting Landscape of Volunteering:&nbsp;</strong>While community engagement through volunteering has been a cornerstone of philanthropy, recent data suggest a decline in formal volunteering numbers. As a community foundation, we need to understand the changing dynamics of volunteerism and explore innovative ways to continue fostering a culture of giving back to our community. Volunteers play a critical role in most nonprofits, and your community foundation is no different. Our board of directors and four advisory boards are comprised of community leaders, business owners, educators, professionals, and more from throughout the region. They help lead the foundation and play a critical role in selecting scholarship recipients and competitive grant awards.</li><li><strong>Rise of Noncash Contributions:&nbsp;</strong>Noncash donations, particularly appreciated stocks, securities, and other noncash assets, have seen a significant uptick. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), among all itemized charitable contributions, the share of noncash donations increased from 27 percent in 2013 to 46 percent in 2021. Understanding the motivations behind noncash giving and its impact on philanthropy allows your foundation to assist with such complex contributions efficiently and effectively.</li></ul><p>Reflecting on these trends, it is evident that the landscape of philanthropy is continuously evolving. As your local community foundation, we are committed to adapting our strategies, leveraging these trends to maximize the impact of our fundholder's charitable giving, and serving as a catalyst for positive change in our community.</p><p>We invite you to join us in shaping a brighter future for our community through your generosity and unwavering support. If you would like more information about starting a fund, becoming a volunteer, or how to make a greater impact with your philanthropy, please give us a call. Together, we can make a meaningful and lasting difference.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

This is a 70 percent increase over the total awards made just four years ago in 2020. The Foundation received 2,271 applications from students throughout the region, with 409 community volunteers investing thousands of hours meticulously reviewing. There were 461 total scholarships awarded from 173 named scholarships. Since 1982, THCF has been dedicated to supporting area students through its scholarship program and has now surpassed $7.5 million in total awards.</p><p>Rachael Cassiday Watkins, THCF Director of Scholarships, expressed her gratitude for the commitment of THCF advisory board members and the dedicated community volunteers who played a critical role in the rigorous review process. \"Every year, members of the THCF advisory boards and dedicated community volunteers join forces to review and evaluate hundreds of scholarship applications,\" Cassiday Watkins stated. \"Without the invaluable support of our volunteers, it would be impossible to accomplish such a task.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 resulted in significant changes to the U.S. tax code. Many of these changes will expire after 2025 unless renewed by Congress.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>I find it interesting that one provision that will not expire is the lowering of the Corporate Tax Rate from 35% to 21%. It was made a permanent change, at least until Congress votes to change it again.</p><p>A major change that impacted charitable contributions was the doubling of the standard deduction and indexing of this amount for inflation. In 2024, the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $29,200 and $14,600 for an individual. Before this change, 30% of households were itemizing their taxes, but only 10% after the change. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates a decrease of $20 billion in charitable giving in 2018. And the study estimates that $16 billion of that charitable giving loss was permanent and did not return in subsequent years, due to having fewer incentives for charitable gifts for tax purposes. &nbsp;</p><p>Now, I don’t believe anyone makes a charitable gift solely for tax purposes, but I do believe it can impact the size of that gift. Truman Heartland Community Foundation (THCF) can help you make an even greater impact through a strategic giving technique called “charitable bunching.” By leveraging this strategy, you can maximize your charitable giving and achieve significant tax benefits. Here’s how.</p><p>Charitable bunching involves consolidating several years' worth of donations into a single tax year to surpass the standard tax deduction and receive a more substantial tax benefit. While this approach requires some careful financial planning, the rewards are well worth it. For instance, if you typically donate around $5,000 annually to your favorite charities, even with other deductions, you may not meet the current standard deduction of $29,200 for married couples. &nbsp;However, by bunching at three years of donations together in a donor advised fund (DAF), you can itemize your $15,000 in donations in the current tax year, leading to a larger tax benefit than if you were to make smaller annual donations. Then, you simply support your favorite charities over the next three years through grants from your DAF. When you make this gift to your DAF by utilizing appreciated securities, you avoid paying the capital gains tax and have 15-20% more to give away, depending on your tax bracket.</p><p>THCF has served as a central hub for philanthropy in suburban Eastern Jackson County for more than 40 years. We enable donors of all kinds to contribute to their favorite causes and organizations. Now is a good time to think about year-end tax planning, so ask your tax professional or financial advisor if charitable bunching could help you maximize your giving. Or call (816-836-8189), click (<a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/\">www.THCF.org</a>), or come by our <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/about/contact-us\">Independence office</a>, and we’ll help you make a lasting difference in your community.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Osage School District who now works mentoring school principals through a program called MLDS, and Karen, who had a successful corporate career at GEHA before starting her own small business, Summit Career Coaching and working for the Lee's Summit Symphony as Community Relations Director, are a dynamic couple who have dedicated their lives to making a meaningful difference in the lives of others.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Both from modest upbringings, they always found ways to give back and do more. Their passion for giving is truly inspiring.</p><p>Their journey in philanthropy began early on in their relationship. Even when they first met in college, they shared a common belief in the power of giving. Karen's vibrant corporate career and John's dedication to education created a solid foundation for them to pursue their passion for serving others. Even in their retirement, they continue to devote their time and energy to projects that bring them joy and make a positive difference in the world.</p><p>What sets John and Karen apart is not only their personal commitment to giving but also their vision for creating a lasting impact for future generations. Karen, a member of the Board of Directors at THCF, has served on numerous committees and is a past board chair. Their involvement with THCF and numerous other nonprofits in the area has provided them with a larger network of friends, connections, and a diverse platform from which to drive change. As members of the foundation’s Legacy Society, the Schulers are helping to ensure the foundation’s future through the Sustainability Fund as part of their estate planning.</p><p>John and Karen's commitment to philanthropy goes beyond their own contributions. They have always made an effort to instill a sense of financial prudence and community responsibility in their children. When their kids got their first lifeguard job, John and Karen opened a 529 college savings account for them. While their kid’s friends were receiving video games and CDs of their favorite bands, John and Karen’s teenage children were receiving contributions that would help them pay for college and ensure a more financially secure future. And while this may not have made them the hippest gift-givers at the time, their forward-thinking reflects their belief in being well-prepared for the future. (And we guarantee that their kid’s accounts are worth more to them than any Wii Sports game or Nickelback album.)</p><p>And just like they have set aside a portion of their estate for the Foundation, they have also set aside a portion of their estate specifically for their adult children’s philanthropy. They hope that by empowering their children to make meaningful contributions to the causes they care about, they will instill in them the values of generosity and community support. John and Karen envision their children adding to the fund and keeping the cycle of giving alive for generations to come, ensuring that the impact of their philanthropic efforts will endure and provide support to important causes long into the future.</p><p>Truman Heartland Community Foundation applauds John and Karen for their exemplary dedication to building a better future for our community. Their thoughtfulness, generosity, and commitment to giving serve as an inspiring example for all of us. We are immensely grateful for their continued partnership and unwavering support in our collective efforts to create positive change.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

If you were to sell the stocks, you would incur capital gains taxes on the appreciated value. However, by instead donating the appreciated stocks to your DAF through your community foundation, you may be able to avoid paying those capital gains taxes altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>By donating the stocks to your DAF, you can receive a tax deduction for the full fair market value of the stocks at the time of the donation. This means that you can support charitable causes, eliminate capital gains taxes, and receive a tax benefit for the donation, all while making a positive impact in your community. This strategy allows you to minimize your tax burden and maximize the value of your charitable contributions.</p><p>Another type of donation that can be impacted by capital gains tax is donating real estate or other tangible assets that have increased in value. If you sell a property or another valuable asset for more than your original purchase price, you will typically owe capital gains tax on the appreciation. However, if you donate the property or asset to your community foundation, you may be able to avoid paying those capital gains taxes and receive a tax deduction for the fair market value of the donated property at the time of the donation. This can be another strategic way to support charitable causes while minimizing your tax burden.&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to note that tax laws and regulations regarding charitable donations and capital gains can be complex, so seeking advice from a qualified tax professional or financial advisor is crucial. They can help you understand the potential tax implications and benefits of making donations and develop a strategy that aligns with their overall financial and philanthropic goals.

Among them are the Truman Heartland Community Foundation’s 2024 Citizens of the Year. From a visionary restaurant manager to a retired professional pilot, a diligent building inspector to a passionate community activist, the 2024 Citizens of the Year embody the true spirit of local philanthropy. </p>\n<p>Each year, local Mayors are asked to select someone from their city who exemplifies philanthropic excellence to be recognized at the foundation’s annual Toast to Our Towns Gala on September 21 at the Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center. This is the list of this year’s honorees:</p>\n<p><strong>Blue Springs – Bobby Hines</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Selected by Mayor Chris Lievsay</strong></p>\n<p>Bobby Hines has been the General Manager of Sandy's Restaurant in Blue Springs for more than a decade, but his contributions to the community go well beyond delicious home-style meals. Although the biscuits at Sandy’s are amazing, Bobby is best known for his thoughtful philanthropy. Bobby is the Founder of the <em>You Matter</em> <em>Movement</em>, providing a wide range of resources for those struggling with mental health, addiction, and homelessness. The Movement also promotes empathy among the public, working to erase the stigma associated with these issues.

He volunteers for Life Sports and Girls on Fire, provides thousands of summer lunches for local youth, and educates high school students on issues around mental health. </p>\n<p><strong>Grain Valley – Eddie Saffell</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Selected by Mayor Mike Todd</strong></p>\n<p>Eddie Saffell's passion for serving his community has been unwavering for more than 40 years. His journey of service began in 1980 as a volunteer firefighter, braving the front lines to ensure the safety of his community. His commitment to public service only grew from there as he transitioned into the role of Deputy Chief at Central Jackson County Fire Protection District for more than 15 years. Eddie's impact expanded beyond his professional roles as he fervently devoted himself to improving his community. Eddie has served on the Grain Valley Board of Education for 12 years, six of which he spent as President. He’s been an active member of the Grain Valley Chamber of Commerce for six years, has served as a volunteer on the fair committee for seven years, and served as a valued member of THCF's Advisory Board for four years. Eddie’s selfless contributions have left an indelible mark, shaping the community for the better and inspiring others to follow in his footsteps.</p>\n<p><strong>Independence – Alversia Pettigrew</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Selected by Mayor Rory Rowland</strong></p>\n<p>The Neck Neighborhood in Independence has a rich history. Established in 1877, the vibrant community was demolished in the 1960s as part of Urban Renewal programs. However, the memory of its residents lives on in McCoy Park, thanks to the efforts of former residents like Alversia Pettigrew. Alversia has received many awards and accolades for her civic contributions over the years, including the prestigious DeVerne Lee Calloway Woman of the Year award for her contributions to equity and social justice, presented by the Women Legislators of Missouri. She's been an active member of the city's Rehabilitation and Housing Board, a supporter of organizations like Boys and Girls Club of Independence and Truman Heritage Habitat for Humanity, and has also volunteered as a historical reenactor at the National Frontier Trails Museum, showcasing her deep commitment to preserving her community's vibrant heritage.</p>\n<p><strong>Lake Tapawingo – Robert Seago</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Selected by Mayor Tom Rodenberg</strong></p>\n<p>Bob Seago served on active duty as a Navy Pilot and then spent 16 years in the naval reserves while also working as a pilot for Continental Airlines. In 2008, when he moved into the Lake Tapawingo community, he was promptly elected to the Board of Alderman, a position he still holds today. Regardless of the weather or time of year, including weekends and holidays, Bob is always on hand to help with any problem, working alongside employees in the field. Bob walks the talk. On a recent holiday weekend, Bob gave the water and sewer employees some much-needed time off. When an issue arose, he was the one out in the heat, working to fix it. Bob is a selfless, hardworking servant of the citizens of Lake Tapawingo, often working quietly behind the scenes to ensure Lake life is as good as it can be for everyone. </p>\n<p><strong>Lee’s Summit – Dave Eames</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Selected by Mayor Bill Baird</strong></p>\n<p>Dave Eames has been a resident of the Lee’s Summit community for more than 30 years. He is always eager to volunteer; whether it's serving on a task force or board, he is an enthusiastic ambassador for his city. Dave, a professional artist and owner of Fossil Forge, has been an essential part of Lee’s Summit’s downtown revitalization efforts, bringing art, color, and light to the city. His passion for creating and refurbishing historical signs and sculptures has transformed the downtown district in a really meaningful way. Dave has served as a former board president of Downtown Lee's Summit Main Street, is on the board of Lee’s Summit Creates, is a member of the Civic Roundtable, and is chairperson of the City’s new Cultural Commission. He has also previously served as an advisory board member for Lee’s Summit Education Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>Oak Grove – Ruth Ann Hafner</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Selected by Mayor Dana Webb</strong></p>\n<p>Since March 2017, Ruth Ann Hafner has been an integral part of the community as a contributing writer for the city’s newspaper, <em>Focus on Oak Grove</em>. Her tenure began the day after the EF3 tornado wreaked havoc on the community. Ruth Ann's outstanding work on that story and many others has been recognized with numerous awards, including the prestigious General Excellence Award in 2018. Not only does she share her culinary expertise through the weekly <em>Skillet Lickin’ Good</em> recipe column, but Ruth Ann also crafts feature stories that shine a spotlight on community, family, civic, school, and governmental news, depicting the events and people that truly shape her community. Her dedication to our community extends beyond her role as a writer, as she has served as Secretary of the Oak Grove Chamber of Commerce Board for seven years and is a current member of the Truman Heartland Community Foundation Advisory Board. Ruth Ann's commitment, passion, and talent will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on the whole community.</p>\n<p><strong>Raytown – Pat Ertz</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Selected by Mike McDonough</strong></p>\n<p>Pat Ertz, a dedicated resident of Raytown since 1989, has been an influential figure in his community. Following a successful career with Hy-Vee, he transitioned to managing the Jackson County Public Water Supply District #2. Pat has selflessly contributed numerous hours to public service, serving on the Board of Aldermen for eight years and even fulfilling the role of Mayor Pro-Tem. Holding volunteer appointments on various committees, such as the Raytown Finance Committee, Recycling Committee, Legislative Committee, and Park Board Governance Committee, among several others, further demonstrates his commitment to public welfare. In addition to his public service, Pat is passionate. He is passionate about giving back as a volunteer, sharing his time and talents with the Raytown Emergency Assistance Program (REAP), Raytown Area Chamber of Commerce and Tourism, Raytown Rotary, and the Raytown Education Foundation.</p>\n<p><strong>Sugar Creek - John C. “Chuck” Mikulich (posthumous)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Selected by Mayor Mike Larson</strong></p>\n<p>Chuck Mikulich's\nunwavering dedication to the community of Sugar Creek is truly inspiring. From his early days as a lifeguard at the Sugar Creek Pool to his 39-year career at TWA, Chuck was always deeply committed to his community. As a long-standing Sugar Creek Alderman, he tirelessly sought feedback from residents, demonstrating his genuine desire to serve. He was actively involved in various community affairs and activities, including his role in organizing the Slavic Festival and co-founding the public service organization \"Go, Sugar Creek.\" Chuck was also committed to uplifting the lives of others, as evidenced by his efforts in building wheelchair ramps, conducting home repairs, and assisting in property sales for low-income individuals and families. His selfless contributions extend to his involvement in various boards and committees, including service on a THCF Advisory Board, exemplifying his unwavering dedication to making his community a better place for all. Chuck's strength of character, work ethic, problem-solving skills, and tremendous sense of humor have left an indelible mark on the whole community, ensuring that he will be remembered for generations to come.</p>\n<p>In a world where kindness and giving back often go unrecognized, it is heartwarming to see individuals celebrated for their philanthropic accomplishments. Truman Heartland Community Foundation's annual Toast to Our Towns Gala serves as a reminder of the impact that these extraordinary individuals have on their communities. Their dedication and generosity set an example for others to follow, inspiring hope and positive change for a brighter future.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">As the landscape of philanthropy continues to evolve, more and more people are looking for innovative and tax-efficient ways to support their favorite charitable causes. Giving through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) is an increasingly popular option with several key benefits.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p><strong>Tax Advantages.</strong> Donating directly from your IRA to a qualified charitable organization can provide significant tax benefits. Individuals aged 70½ or older can make tax-free transfers of up to $105,000 per year from their IRAs to qualified charities. This can satisfy required minimum distributions (RMDs) while reducing taxable income, providing a valuable tax-saving opportunity. </p>\n<p><strong>Impact Giving. </strong>When you use your IRA for charitable donations, you can make a significant impact on the causes you care about. While rules prevent the use of QCDs to establish a donor advised fund, you can use QCDs to set up a scholarship fund or field of interest fund or contribute to the competitive grant process at your community foundation. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Simplified Process.</strong> Making charitable gifts through your IRA can streamline the donation process. Direct transfers from your IRA to a charity or community foundation are excluded from federal income tax, making giving more efficient and hassle-free.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Estate Planning Benefits. </strong>By designating charitable organizations or your fund as beneficiaries of your IRA, you can contribute to worthy causes while reducing the impact of income and estate taxes on your heirs. This approach can offer estate planning advantages and create a lasting philanthropic legacy that could last for generations.</p>\n<p>Giving through your IRA is just one way to maximize your charitable impact while benefiting from valuable tax advantages.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">In recent years, there has been a notable shift in the landscape of post-secondary education. The average age of people working in the trades is within 10 years of retirement, and the number of young people entering the trades is not keeping pace.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>If the current trend continues, the sector will not be able to fill all the open positions of those who retire in the next decade. While traditional four-year colleges and universities have long been the go-to choice for many students, with a surplus of openings in skilled trades, there is a growing trend toward vocational programs and trade schools. These institutions, which focus on teaching specific trades and skills, are gaining popularity at a remarkable pace. </p>\n<p>According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, enrollment in vocational programs has seen a substantial 16 percent increase from 2022 to 2023, a trend that shows no signs of slowing down. Mechanic and repair trade programs alone saw an 11.5% rise in student numbers. This rise in enrollment is indicative of the burgeoning demand for skilled technicians in various sectors, including the automotive, machinery, and construction trades. </p>\n<p>What sets trade schools apart from traditional higher education institutions is their specialized training and relatively shorter programs. This makes them an appealing option for individuals who are eager to enter the workforce quickly. However, despite the numerous benefits, cost remains a significant concern for many prospective students. The tuition fees associated with trade programs can still pose a barrier, especially for those from lower-income backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there is hope on the horizon for aspiring skilled trade professionals. Scholarships for trade schools are becoming increasingly available from a variety of sources, ranging from the federal government to trade unions and local community foundations. These scholarships play a crucial role in making trade education more accessible and affordable for students from all walks of life.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption left\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2024/_smallBodyImage/Cables.jpg\" alt=\"Older couple holding sign reading Educate\"><figcaption>Joanne and Gene Cable</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Gene and Joanne Cable, owners of Cable Chevrolet for nearly 40 years, actively served and supported the Eastern Jackson County region both with talent and treasure. When Gene passed away in 2022 at the age of 96, Joanne chose to honor her late husband by establishing a scholarship in memory of Gene in the hopes that it will support others who are pursuing careers in the automotive industry. This act of community support and shared responsibility is a testament to the belief in the potential of trade education and the importance of investing in the future of our industries.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2024/_smallBodyImage/Hunter-McMullen.png\" alt=\"young man in red graduation outfit with cords\"><figcaption>Hunter McMullen</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This year's recipient of the Gene Cable Automotive Scholarship is Hunter McMullen. Hunter graduated from Lee’s Summit North this spring and is pursuing the General Motors Automotive Service Educational Program (ASEP) at MCC Longview with the aim of becoming a world-class technician. Hunter is employed at Cable Dahmer Chevrolet as a Lube Technician and has already earned multiple ASE (Automotive Service Excellence) certifications through Herdon Career Center's automotive technology program.</p>\n<p>“The scholarship allows me to attend college [and] afford tools,” Hunter said in his thank you letter to the scholarship selection team. “I hope to be able to pay my mom back for all she’s done for me someday, using the job provided by this program.” And with an average starting salary of GM ASEP grads of $59,000, his mom is surely in for a real treat. </p>\n<p>The growing popularity of trade schools reflects a shift in the perception of non-traditional education pathways. As the demand for skilled workers continues to rise across various industries, trade schools serve as an invaluable resource for individuals seeking rewarding and high-demand careers. With the availability of scholarships, like the Gene Cable Automotive Scholarship, more students can now pursue their passion for skilled trades without the burden of overwhelming financial barriers.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Headshots/Staff/_smallThumbnail/Rachael-WEB.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" loading=\"lazy\">\n        <div class=\"side-text\">\n      <p class=\"small-text\">Scholarship Program</p>      <h2>Questions?</h2>      <p>Rachael Watkins is here to help; email Watkins@thcf.org or call (816) 912-4185.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:watkins@thcf.org\">Email Watkins@thcf.org</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

They prefer to stay parked and thrive.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p><strong>Charitable vehicles. </strong>I’m not talking about donating old cars or trucks to charity. I’m talking about the kinds of charitable vehicles that can help you donate to charity <u>and</u> potentially save money on your taxes. Just like cars, there are a wide variety of makes and models of charitable vehicles to choose from, each with its own unique features and benefits. Choosing the right one depends on your personal circumstances, financial goals, and philanthropic interests, but here is a short list of popular options.</p>\n<p><strong>Donor Advised Funds</strong> (DAFs): These funds are like having your own personal charitable savings accounts. Donors contribute to their fund, enjoy tax benefits for the contribution, and can recommend grants to their favorite charities and causes over time. </p><figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2024/_smallBodyImage/funding-sustainability.jpg\" alt=\"growing change\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Charitable Trusts</strong>: These are legal arrangements that allow individuals to set aside their present and future assets for charitable purposes while retaining both a current income stream and other benefits. There are different types of charitable trusts, including charitable remainder trusts and charitable lead trusts.</p>\n<p><strong>Private Family Foundations:</strong>\nPrivate Foundations are independent legal entities usually set up by an individual family to support their charitable activities. This vehicle offers donors a great deal of administrative responsibility and control over how their charitable dollars are distributed.</p>\n<p><strong>Scholarship Funds</strong>: These funds are often created in memory or honor of a loved one. Donors who are passionate about education have the opportunity to design their own eligibility criteria and requirements and choose how much they want to participate in the student selection process. </p>\n<p><strong>Beneficiary Designations: </strong>You can easily make any eligible nonprofit a beneficiary of your IRA by simply updating your beneficiary form. You can name your favorite charitable organization or even your DAF to receive a specific percentage of your retirement account. Retirement funds given to your heirs will be taxed as ordinary income, which is why these types of assets are some of the best to donate to charity.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2023/_smallBodyImage/endowments-and-Bequests.jpg\" alt=\"bequest\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Bequests</strong>: Specific language can easily be added to will or trust documents instructing a gift to charity from your estate upon death. Bequests are one of the easiest ways to leave a legacy. And bequests can be made to one or several entities, specified by a specific dollar amount or percentage of the donor's estate.</p>\n<p>Once you have decided on the right vehicle for you, you need to find it a new home where it can be kept safe and secure. There are lots of options out there for you, and you should consult with your professional financial advisor or attorney to find the best parking spot for your charitable plan. Just remember that your local community foundation is here for you with a knowledgeable staff that is ready to provide professional guidance, administrative support, investment management, and more. We are dedicated to helping your charitable vehicle operate smoothly and efficiently, supporting your philanthropic efforts for generations to come.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

Due to the slow pace of overland communication and the lack of Union presence in states like Texas at the time, the news of emancipation took a little over two months to reach all corners of the country. Major Gorgan Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, bringing news of freedom to the last group of enslaved people in the United States, marking the date now celebrated as Juneteenth. </p>\n<p>\"Juneteenth is not only a celebration of the remarkable resilience of people in the past,\" noted Phil Hanson, President and CEO of Truman Heartland Community Foundation, \"but it’s also about celebrating the achievements of people of color today and showing the depth and breadth of this dynamic community's growth and success. We’re proud to support such a worthwhile community event.\"</p>\n<p>A stage for live musical performances by LeVelle, Sensational Wonders, JahVelle, Lori Tucker and Millie Edwards will be set up inside the Independence Uptown Market pavilion. A variety of vendors and community organizations, like the Mid-Continent Public Library’s Reading Rocket, will be set up underneath the open-air pavilion to engage visitors. Lots of food options will be available for purchase from Amiya Faye Catering, LLC, Chef Tim’s Food Truck, Sweet Peaches Cobblers, and Vee’s BBQ Truck. At sundown, visitors can enjoy a free screening of the movie “I’m So Glad” at the nearby Pharoah Theater.</p>\n<p>For more information about this community-driven event led by Anthony J.

Here is an easy giving checklist to help you do more and (hopefully) save more.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>1. <strong>Determine your philanthropic and financial goals.</strong> Once you have an idea of what you want to achieve, you can start creating a plan to align your charitable giving with your overall financial strategy.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Research and consider different giving options.</strong> There are several options available, each with its own tax advantages and implications. For instance, giving through your estate plan, which typically involves a larger gift. Even if you choose to allocate a small portion of your estate (5-10%), it has the opportunity to grow over time. Establishing a bequest can help reduce estate taxes, leaving your beneficiaries with more of your estate to distribute to those charities close to your heart. Another option is a donor advised fund (DAF), which can provide immediate tax benefits and the flexibility to recommend grants from the fund. This allows you to schedule your grants in a way that works best for you. You may also receive a reduction in income tax, capital gains tax, and/or estate tax by using a DAF. Additionally, you can choose to donate directly from your checking account, which may result in a deduction if you qualify for an itemized tax return. </p>\n<p>4. <strong>Always seek the guidance of a financial advisor or tax professional </strong>to determine the best approach for your specific situation. Their expertise can provide reassurance and help you lay out a realistic plan for your giving that aligns with your values and long-term financial strategy.</p>\n<p>5. <strong>Your giving plan is flexible</strong>. Over time, your charitable interests may change, and that's okay. Review your plan every couple of years to ensure it continues to meet your philanthropic and financial goals, allowing you to adapt and grow with your giving.</p>\n<p>There are numerous charitable giving options that provide various tax advantages and can be tailored to meet your philanthropic and financial goals. When you’re ready to start marking off your checklist, consult with a financial advisor or tax professional to determine the best options for your specific situation.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">When it comes to philanthropy and charitable giving, individuals, families, and businesses have the power to make a significant impact on their community. They can choose to establish a fund at their local community foundation, set up a private family foundation, or even do both.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>These options, while different, share the common goal of supporting charitable causes. By establishing a fund at a community foundation, donors can leverage the foundation's expertise in identifying and addressing local needs, while setting up a private family foundation offers more autonomy and control. Regardless of the approach, the ultimate goal is to serve and support the causes that align with the donor's values and beliefs.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Foundations. <br>\n</strong>Community foundations are 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations that serve a specific geographic area, such as a city, region, or state. For instance, the Truman Heartland Community Foundation (THCF) serves the residents of Eastern Jackson, Cass, and Lafayette County communities. Community foundations are typically established and funded by a broad base of donors, including individuals, families, and corporations within the community. The donations made through a community foundation, using a donor-advised fund, field of interest fund, or other charitable vehicle, can be used to make grants to local nonprofit organizations and address specific community needs. This means that as a donor, you have the power to make a significant impact on your community, influencing its development and well-being. </p>\n<p>Fundholders can also make grants to organizations outside of our local community as well, both nationally and internationally. In 2023, THCF fundholders awarded more than $7.3 million in competitive community grants, donor-directed grants, and scholarship awards.</p>\n<p>Community foundations, such as THCF, are deeply rooted in their communities. They play a pivotal role in community development by identifying and addressing the most pressing needs within their geographic area. THCF has spearheaded innovative work engaging older adults and underserved populations in civic engagement, promoting and teaching youth philanthropy, finding opportunities for adult education and training, and now, we are exploring issues related to affordable housing. By engaging with local nonprofits and community leaders, community foundations like THCF work to create positive, sustainable change within the communities they serve, fostering a sense of connection and engagement among the community members.</p>\n<p><strong>Private Family Foundations. <br>\n</strong>Private family foundations are usually set up and financed by a single family or a small group of related individuals. They are organized as a trust or nonprofit corporation with the assistance of attorneys and accountants and are often established to embody the philanthropic interests and principles of the founding family. Depending on the preferences of the family members involved, family foundations have the potential to contribute to a wide array of causes, including national and international organizations.</p>\n<p>Family foundations offer a more hands-on approach to philanthropy through a legal entity created by the donors, with their own Board of Directors or Trustees. They often provide a platform for family members to come together and make decisions about charitable giving, allowing them to have a more direct impact on the causes they care about. Additionally, private family foundations can serve as a way to pass down important values and create an ongoing philanthropic legacy within the family. The ability of the family foundation to support a wide range of causes makes it a popular choice for families looking to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Differences.<br>\n</strong>While both community and private family foundations share the overarching goal of supporting charitable causes, there are several key differences. Community foundations are community-focused, serving a specific geographic area and addressing local needs, while private family foundations are often driven by the charitable interests and values of a single family. Additionally, community foundations typically draw support from a wide range of donors within the community. In contrast, private family foundations are funded by a single family or a small group of related individuals.</p>\n<p>The two types of foundations also have different filing and reporting requirements. When using a community foundation for giving, donors avoid the day-to-day operational and management responsibilities of their fund, make grants on a schedule that works for them, and receive a more significant tax benefit due to higher deductible limits (60% of AGI). Additionally, donors who utilize a community foundation for their giving don't have to disclose the details of their donations, keeping their giving information private and avoiding unwanted solicitations. </p>\n<p>Private foundations have a lower deductible ceiling of just 30% of AGI and are subject to excise taxes of 1.39% of the net investment income. Many estate planning attorneys recommend a minimum gift of $5 million to establish a private family foundation. They also require annual distributions of at least 5% of the value of assets each year. However, family foundations are still a good option for high-net-worth individuals who want more control over their giving. Private foundations offer maximum control with hands-on management, including the appointment of the Board of Directors.</p>\n<p>Community and private family foundations are vital in advancing philanthropy and creating positive change. Understanding the differences between the two will help individuals and families make informed decisions about their charitable giving and maximize their impact on the causes they care about most. Feel free to contact Cole Eason, Vice President of Advancement at THCF, to see which option (or both) might be best for you.

But don't worry; your community foundation is not some kind of magical or mysterious entity - the only magic we have is the amazing transformation your philanthropy can have on a community. </p>\n<p>In fact, a community foundation is simply a group of people coming together to pool their resources to better support their charitable causes. It's like a potluck, but instead of food, everyone brings their generosity and kindness to the table. And just like a potluck, people of all financial means can participate in pooling resources, so there are more goodies to go around.</p>\n<p>At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we offer a variety of charitable vehicles to help individuals and families give back to their community in a tax-wise and effective manner. Donor advised funds, scholarship funds, endowment funds, you name it - we've got it. Plus, we offer personalized services to help you achieve your philanthropic goals. </p>\n<p>Community foundations are governed by a volunteer board of directors made up of community leaders from every sector, with everyone bringing their unique gifts and contributions to the table. At THCF, we also have four advisory boards representing several different areas of suburban Eastern Jackson County. In addition, we support local high school students in philanthropy through the Youth Advisory Council (YAC). It is important that no matter the age or income bracket, everyone is welcome at the community foundation table.</p>\n<p>So, if you want to make a difference in your community, there's really no mystery to it - just reach out to <a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Cole Eason</a>, VP of Advancement at your friendly neighborhood community foundation.

Establishing a donor advised fund (DAF) helps you organize your company’s giving in a convenient, easy to manage, and tax-wise structure. Your company can make a contribution to the DAF at any time and receive a tax benefit in that same year. Donations, in the form of grants, can be made to the charity or charities of your choice at a later date. It’s a flexible way to simplify your corporate giving.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><strong>Corporate scholarship.</strong> Creating a scholarship fund is an excellent way to leave your mark on your industry. Your corporate scholarship fund can be tailored to meet your company's charitable objectives and offer valuable financial assistance to students. Whether you prefer to lead the selection process or leave it to our community volunteers, have a lot of selection criteria, or want to keep it general, we are committed to helping you invest in the next generation of industry leaders.</li></ul>\n<p>These are only a few examples of ways you can get your business involved in local philanthropy through your community foundation. We have decades of experience in helping people do amazing things with their giving. Everything from offering regular volunteer opportunities to your staff, sponsoring community events hosted by local nonprofits, or offering pro-bono services are all great ways to give back, too. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>However you choose to do it, we thank you for using your business to create a better community.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">Bob Glaser is a man who needs no introduction. He’s a legend in the community, and for good reason. His involvement in the community is unparalleled; he is a connector, leader, and changemaker. It’s safe to say that he’s touched countless lives so far and shows no sign of slowing down any time soon.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Bob’s career path has been pretty interesting. On the day he retired from Sears at 55 years old, he had nine job offers on the table. That’s the kind of man Bob is - hardworking, dedicated, motivated, and highly respected. Bob eventually landed at Truman Heartland Community Foundation (back then, it was called the Independence Community Foundation). He didn’t even know what a community foundation was when he started; he just knew he wanted to help. As he learned the ropes, he quickly became passionate about the mission and the power community foundations have to change and lift whole communities. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Bob’s legacy at Truman Heartland Community Foundation is one that will never be forgotten. He was the very first CEO of the foundation, and he led with great passion and dedication. In 2018, he was recognized as the foundation’s Humanitarian of the Year for his work with nonprofits throughout Eastern Jackson County. He is a true believer in the power of the THCF mission – private giving for the public good and is a proud donor advised fundholder and Legacy Society member. </p>\n<p>When he was directing the foundation, he recognized the need to establish a signature special event to strengthen the organization by raising additional funds for foundation operations. Today, we call this very special annual event the <em>Toast to Our Towns Gala</em>. </p>\n<p>The very first gala was held at the newly renovated RLDS Auditorium in Independence. It was a black-tie event, but because it was at a religious institution, no alcohol was allowed. A pre-gala cocktail party was held down the way, and streetcar shuttles took people from the bar back up to the event. They also had a bus borrowed from the Heartland Trailways Bus Company. Although it seemed like a good idea at the time, the electronics and hydraulics went out on the bus, rendering the door useless. Guests, dressed in tuxedoes, ballgowns, and all their finery, had no choice but to shimmy through the windows to get out. Despite the unexpected climbing adventure, everyone had a great time, making it a huge success and a very memorable event. </p>\n<p>In a different year, the gala was held at the Truman Library to mix it up (and avoid the need for any buses). Pre-gala cocktails were served in the library, and it was only a short walk down to the tent in the parking lot where dinner would be served. All was going according to plan … until … thirty minutes into dinner, the generator for the tent completely died. No amount of button-pushing, pounding, or pleading would make it start up again. Quick-witted as ever, Bob tied back the flaps to the tent and had staff pull their cars around and turn on their headlights. Stan Crumbaugh saved the day by retrieving a small generator that would run the microphone, and the program continued as if it had been planned that way all along. Bob swears he had a full head of jet-black hair until that night! </p>\n<p>Today, the Toast to Our Towns Gala is still going strong. We’ve come a long way from our humble beginnings, but the spirit of community and philanthropy that Bob instilled all those years ago lives on. Bob once said he wanted to be remembered as a man who tried to make his community a better place. He plans on attending this year’s annual <strong>Toast to Our Towns Gala on September 21</strong>, as he always does. Make plans to <a href=\"https://thcf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/list/event?event_date_id=3245\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reserve a table or grab some tickets</a> and tell him in person what a profound impact he has had (and continues to have) on Eastern Jackson County and beyond! </p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

These programs promise future funding for the organization, which is essential for sustainability and growth.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>A well-cultivated relationship with donors who have planned gifts in their will or trust can help nonprofits plan ahead, budget for the future, and even prepare for economic crises.</p>\n<p>One of the advantages of a well-developed planned giving program is that planned gifts are often large donations that require little cost to secure. This makes planned giving a highly cost-effective way to fundraise, with an average return of $56.83 per dollar spent, compared to $33.33 for major giving and $8.41 for regular giving, according to a 2013 AskRIGHT study.</p>\n<p>Some nonprofit professionals worry that planned gifts may reduce the total annual giving to their organizations. However, research by Dr. Russell James has found that planned giving can actually trigger a 75% increase in annual gifts. Donors who add a charity to their will typically increase their annual gifts by more than $3,000 in the following years. Furthermore, even among those who don't increase their gifts, 47% of donors maintain their annual giving rates without cutting into annual giving revenue. </p>\n<p>If you're looking to establish or refresh your nonprofit’s planned giving program, Truman Heartland Community Foundation can be a valuable resource. By partnering with us, donors can leave a lasting legacy and make a significant impact on your organization’s mission.

So many, in fact, that it can sometimes be difficult to keep it all straight.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Two popular options today are donor advised funds (DAF) and private family foundations. You may think you know the difference, but do you really? Here are some common myths about donor advised funds and family foundations that you may have heard.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth 1: Donor Advised Funds are good for people with only a small amount of money to give. Family Foundations are better if you have a large amount to contribute.</strong><br></p>\n<p><em>FALSE</em>. A donor advised fund at THCF offers maximum tax benefits compared to a family foundation, regardless of the size of the account. If you donate cash, the IRS allows you to claim a deduction of up to 60 percent of your adjusted gross income (AGI). With a private foundation, the deduction is half that, at 30 percent. If you have appreciated assets, like securities or closely held stock, you can claim an AGI deduction of up to 30 percent per year, whereas a private foundation has an AGI limitation of 20 percent. </p>\n<p>Plus, with your community foundation DAF, you can claim the deduction for your cash or securities donation in the year it is made and also have up to five carry-forward years for any unused balance. </p>\n<p><strong>Myth 2: A donor advised fund is too complicated and time-consuming to manage on your own.</strong></p>\n<p><em>FALSE. </em>The day-to-day administration of a private foundation can take more time and energy than some people want to take on. In addition, the tax rules related to private foundation investments, distributions, and “self-dealing” have become more challenging to navigate and may even prevent some people from maximizing the tax benefits of their charitable giving. We often see that when the family members who handled these kinds of functions for a family foundation retire, pass away, or simply become busy with other projects, the administrative load can easily become overwhelming for the rest of the family.</p>\n<p>A DAF allows donors to manage their giving with a flexible online account. With just a few clicks, you can donate to your DAF account, issue grants to your favorite organizations, receive statements and reports, and much more. With the expert guidance of the THCF team and your financial advisor's collaboration, it is actually really easy to use your DAF to make a meaningful impact in Eastern Jackson County and beyond. Plus, with your endowed DAF, THCF will ensure your gifts continue your legacy for generations to come. </p>\n<p><strong>Myth 3: There is no such thing as a confidential or private donation. </strong></p>\n<p><em>FALSE. </em>Information about private foundations is, ironically, not at all private. The IRS provides public access to all Form 990 tax returns for private foundations, which includes information on everything from revenue and expenditures to income data and grants. </p>\n<p>In contrast, a donor advised fund at your community foundation is completely private and confidential. While most donors still choose to provide information about themselves to the organizations they donate to through their donor advised fund, they have the option of truly anonymous granting as well. </p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Both donor advised funds and private family foundations have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. However, it's essential to have a clear understanding of these vehicles' myths and facts before making a decision. Donor advised funds offer numerous benefits, including more significant tax advantages, easy management, and confidentiality. On the other hand, private family foundations are more suitable for families who really want to be in the weeds with the regulatory and record-keeping requirements. Regardless of which option you choose, it's crucial to work with a trusted financial advisor to maximize the impact of your philanthropic efforts.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

YAC students were up early on a brisk Saturday morning. It may have been chilly, but the spirit of generosity quickly warmed them as they collected nonperishable food and household items from patrons shopping at one of the four participating Hy-Vee stores in the area. Their efforts were met with an overwhelmingly positive response from the community, who generously donated thousands of items. From toilet paper and toothpaste to spaghetti and cereals, shoppers were generous with their kind words and smiles, too. The items collected were distributed to individuals and families in need through Raytown Emergency Assistance Program (REAP), Community Services League, and Lee’s Summit Social Services. This food drive is always a feel-good event, as both the YAC students and their adult volunteers get the opportunity to see first-hand the positive impact they can have on the lives of their neighbors.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/YAC/Strike-in-the-Night/_smallBodyImage/20230401_210832.jpg\" alt=\"Five young people at the bowling ally\"><figcaption>Strike in the Night 2023</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another exciting activity for these student leaders is the Youth Advisory Council’s Annual Fundraiser, Strike in the Night - Cosmic Caring Changing the Universe. This highly anticipated bowling event will take place on the evening of Saturday, April 27. It's sure to be a night full of trivia, games, food, and, of course, cosmic bowling. The proceeds from this family-friendly event will go to the YAC endowment fund, which will provide additional funds to be distributed during the foundation’s grant process later this year. The event promises to be a fun-filled evening for all. <a href=\"https://thcf.fcsuite.com/erp/donate/list/event?event_date_id=3310\">Sponsorship opportunities</a> are still available for those who want to get involved.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption left\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/YAC/Strike-in-the-Night/_smallBodyImage/IMG20230401205853.jpg\" alt=\"Student holding &quot;Thank You Sponsors&quot; sign.\"></figure>\n<p>Youth philanthropy is a vital part of any community, yet it is often overlooked in favor of more competitive high school activities. If you know of a student who has a big heart, likes giving back, and wants to meet students from other schools in a cooperative setting, YAC may be the perfect fit! Colleges and employers like to see extracurricular activities on student resumes and applications. YAC is the ideal way to show personal drive and community commitment. Have your student reach out to the YAC Team Leader at their school, visit our website at www.thcf.org/students, or reach out to Diana Castillo, Director of Grants and Donor Services, who leads the program at (816) 912-4184 or <a href=\"mailto:castillo@thcf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">castillo@thcf.org</a> for more information.

Led by Truman Heartland, this community-focused program nurtures the next generation of philanthropic leaders. It's inspiring to see our YAC students actively participating in their community.

This mandatory withdrawal is known as Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) is a type of gift made directly from your IRA to a qualified charity that can help fulfill your RMD. The QCD amount is not included in your taxable income. Although <strong>a QCD cannot be made to a donor advised fund</strong>, it can be used to contribute to your scholarship fund or a fund designated for a specific charity. Not meeting your RMD can result in substantial penalties, so using this giving vehicle can be very beneficial.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say that you are 75 and have contributed to a tax-deferred retirement plan throughout your career. Now retired, to fulfill your RMD, you are required to withdraw $10,000 each year. Instead of withdrawing the entire amount and paying income tax on it, you can choose to donate all or a portion, let’s say $5,000, directly to a nonprofit organization or a designated fund at your community foundation through a QCD. This will satisfy your RMD requirement. You can continue to support the same charity year after year, fulfill your RMD requirement, and avoid those pesky tax penalties.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">Donor advised funds (DAFs) are becoming an increasingly popular way for individuals and families to donate to charitable causes. One of the main advantages of using a DAF is that it simplifies the process of giving to charities.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Instead of writing checks or giving cash directly to a nonprofit organization, the donor can make a grant from their DAF to the charity of their choice. This process is often easier and more efficient than traditional methods of giving, as the donor can manage all of their charitable giving from one central online account.</p>\n<p>Having a digital account means donors don't have to keep track of multiple receipts and stacks of paperwork, which can be time-consuming and cumbersome to collect and organize. By using a DAF, donors can streamline their charitable giving and get timely reports on their accounts, allowing them to focus their energy on the organizations and causes they care about most.</p>\n<p>Additionally, using a DAF can provide people who already give to charity regularly with several tax benefits. When a donor contributes to a DAF, they receive an immediate tax deduction for the amount of the contribution, even though the funds may not be distributed to charities until a later date. In this way, a DAF allows donors maximum tax benefits with complete flexibility for the donor. Plus, DAFs allow for tax-free growth of assets. Once a donor contributes to a DAF, the assets can grow tax-free, allowing more money to be ultimately given to their favorite charities over time. </p>\n<p>DAFs also provide for anonymity in charitable giving. Some donors may be uncomfortable with public recognition or may prefer to keep their personal financial information confidential. Other donors may wish to avoid being solicited by other organizations or individuals seeking donations.

Are you ready?</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Changes in tax laws have made it more challenging to claim donations to qualified charities through itemized deductions on your tax return. But there are still ways to make charitable gifts work for the causes you believe in while also saving on taxes.</p>\n<p>It has become much more challenging to itemize your taxes with the standard tax deduction for individuals, currently at $14,600 and $29,200 for married couples. If you fall short of the standard deduction, you can utilize your charitable giving to give you the boost you need to qualify by using a charitable bunching strategy. </p>\n<p>A charitable bunching strategy involves utilizing a Donor Advised Fund to group or “bunch“ your contributions that you would make over several years in one tax year. For instance, you could group all your charitable donations together every third year and contribute to (or establish) a donor advised fund with an amount equal to the total needed for three years of giving. In the year you contribute to your donor advised fund, you can itemize your deductions when filing your tax return and receive a sizable deduction. In the following two years, you can continue to support your favorite charities by making donations in the form of grants from your donor advised fund and claim the standard deduction on your tax returns. This method allows you to maximize the tax benefit of your charitable contributions. </p>\n<figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2024/_largeBodyImage/with-without-2024.png\" alt=\"Graphic showing deductions with and without bunching\"></figure>\n<p>Additionally, with a donor advised fund, your donations are invested and grow tax-free, ultimately giving you the ability to donate more to charity over time. And if, instead of using cash, you utilize appreciated stock to make a donation into your donor advised fund, you can also avoid paying the capital gains tax on the appreciated stock.<br></p>\n<p>So, while tax laws may have made it harder to claim donations to qualified charities on your taxes when itemizing, a bunching strategy can help you exceed the standard deduction amount and maximize the tax benefits of your charitable contributions. At Truman Heartland Community Foundation, we are committed to helping you achieve your charitable goals while making the process of giving simple and stress-free.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">When it comes to charitable giving, endowment is a term that is often used. But what does it actually mean?</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p> In simple terms, an endowment is a fund that is set up by an organization or individual to provide a source of income for a specific charitable purpose. While the term may seem complex, understanding the basics of endowment can help you make informed decisions when it comes to your charitable giving and legacy planning.</p>\n<p>Endowments are typically created as a way to ensure the long-term sustainability of an organization or specific cause. The funds are invested at your community foundation, with the income generated from those investments being used to support the charity or cause of your choice. The major difference between an endowment fund and a typical investment fund is that the benefactor of an endowment fund is one or more non-profit organizations instead of individual investors. Typically, the principal value of an endowment fund is kept intact, while the investment income is used for charitable purposes in the form of grants. This allows the organizations you choose to have a consistent and reliable source of income over time. </p>\n<p>That is one of the key benefits of building your fund to endowment; it can provide a stable source of funding over a long period of time, which can be especially important for nonprofits that may experience fluctuations in funding from year to year. By having an endowment, the organization you support can better plan for the future and ensure they are able to continue to provide services or support their mission even during lean years.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of endowment is that it can provide a lasting legacy for donors. When you create an endowed fund with a planned gift, cash, equities, bonds, and other types of securities, your donation is invested and will continue to generate income. This means that your gift can have a long-lasting impact on the community, even after you are gone.</p>\n<p>And while endowments can be a powerful tool for charitable giving, it is important to understand that not all endowments are created equal. Some endowments may have restrictions on how the funds can be used, while others have been created to be more flexible. It is important to carefully review the terms and conditions of any endowment before making a donation to ensure that your gift will be used in the way that you intend. Be sure to talk to your professional financial advisor to learn which type will best work with your long-term charitable goals. </p>\n<p>Establishing an endowment at the community foundation is a powerful tool for ensuring the long-term sustainability of your favorite nonprofit organizations and causes. By providing a reliable source of income over time, the endowments that you create can help to ensure that organizations are able to continue to pursue their mission and make a difference in our community and the world. If you are thinking about your legacy, planning to endow your fund is a great way to create something special and support the causes you care about for generations to come.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

The Grants Committee has recently made some changes to the program in 2024. Our workshop aims to equip grant writers with the necessary tools and knowledge to understand the changes and navigate our grants process with ease.\"</p>\n<p>Additional program changes of note include the implementation of a three-year rule, where organizations can receive funding for up to three consecutive years before needing to sit out one year. Also, organizations can now only apply for either the Community Grant program or the Jelley Family Foundation Endowment for Children's Education Grants, but not both. Finally, to ensure a diverse portfolio of nonprofits being funded, the foundation will now allocate 10% of its annual competitive grant funding specifically for new organizations that have not received foundation grants in the past. </p>\n<p>\"These changes will enable the foundation to continue its support for a wide range of nonprofit organizations,\" Castillo continued, \"working to address critical issues and create positive change in our suburban Eastern Jackson and Cass Counties communities.\"</p>\n<p>This workshop is in high demand, and therefore, the foundation requests that only one person per organization register due to limited space. The session will be recorded and made available on the THCF website. Organizations that serve suburban Eastern Jackson and Cass County and have never received grant funding from THCF in the past are strongly encouraged to apply. However, it is important to note that attendance at this workshop does not impact any organization's ability to receive a THCF competitive grant. </p>\n<p>Registration for THCF’s Competitive Grants Workshop is currently open and available at <a href=\"http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=ijy86dwab&amp;oeidk=a07ek6vjpvfdf9b560c\">http://events.constantcontact.com/register/event?llr=ijy86dwab&amp;oeidk=a07ek6vjpvfdf9b560c</a>. <br></p>\n<p>More information about the competitive grants program, including eligibility criteria and areas of service, can be found at the foundation's website, <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/grant-seekers\">https://www.thcf.org/grant-seekers</a>, or by contacting the Director of Grants and Donor Services, Diana Castillo, at (816) 912-4184 or castillo@thcf.org. </p>\n<p><small class=\"footnote\"><strong><em>Truman Heartland Community Foundation</em></strong><em> is a public charity committed to improving area communities by promoting and serving private giving for the public good.

This year, the foundation is proud to make approximately $800K in scholarship funds available to students throughout the area. However, recent changes to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) are causing problems and delays for students.</p>\n<p>If you plan to pursue higher education in the Fall, it is important to know about recent changes to the FAFSA, the US Department of Education’s form that gathers information about students’ financial situation to help determine their eligibility for federal financial aid. Many organizations and institutions, including THCF, use data from the FAFSA Submission Summary to evaluate the financial need of scholarship applicants.</p>\n<p>Changes to the FAFSA form for the 2024-2025 school year became available on December 31, 2023. Typically, the FAFSA is available in October each year, but due to the form change, the FAFSA was delayed. Additionally, there appears to be continuing issues with the online form, as students find the form is sometimes offline and unavailable. Because of this delay, THCF application timelines have been adjusted as well. The THCF General Application was available starting December 15, 2023 and will remain open until April 1, 2024. All essays, letters of recommendation, and other documents that may be required must be submitted by the deadline without exception. If you want to learn more about the FAFSA changes, visit www.mofafsa.org.</p>\n<p>Establishing a scholarship fund at Truman Heartland is a great way to leave a lasting legacy. Donors can create a scholarship fund to honor the memory of a loved one or support a cause they are passionate about. We work with our fundholders to create specific criteria for their scholarship based on things that are important to them, such as academic achievement, financial need, or community service and involvement. By establishing a scholarship fund at your community foundation, you can make a significant impact on the lives of countless students and support the community for generations to come. It is a meaningful way to give back and create a legacy.</p>\n<p>THCF is committed to helping donors achieve their philanthropic goals and students achieve their academic goals.

These trusts offer numerous benefits, including the ability to allocate inheritance to heirs over an extended period, significantly reduce estate and income taxes, and leave a significant legacy to your preferred charity.</p>\n<p>To illustrate, consider the following example of a \"Give it Twice\" Trust. Mrs. Flintstone had an estate that included an IRA and other assets valued at $350,000. Wilma wished to leave $250,000 from her IRA to her grandchildren, but not all at once, and gift $100,000 to her children. As a result, Wilma established a 20-year, 5 percent \"Give it Twice\" Trust for her grandchildren's benefit through her estate plan.</p>\n<p>When Wilma passes, her estate will transfer $250,000 from her IRA to the trust, avoiding taxation on this portion of her IRA. Her grandchildren received trust income annually for 20 years, with an estimated total revenue of $303,717 over the trust term. Once all income payments to the grandchildren had been made, Wilma's preferred charity received an estimated $371,487.</p>\n<p>By creating a \"Give it Twice\" Trust, Wilma was able to determine the amount, frequency, and duration of her grandchildren's inheritance, allowing her to preserve the principal value of her IRA investment and provide more significant payouts to her grandchildren while leaving a substantial remainder for charity.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to schedule a one-on-one meeting with Cole Eason, our Vice President of Advancement, to learn more about the benefits of using a \"Give it Twice\" Trust to support your preferred charities at Truman Heartland. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to help you achieve your legacy planning goals while making a meaningful impact in your community.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

The days that once felt like an eternity as children now seem to pass us by in the blink of an eye. Before we know it, January arrives to remind us to reflect on how far we've come and consider where we are going. Although it seems impossible that 2013 was a decade ago, ten years have indeed passed, and we'd like to reflect on what the people of our communities have been able to accomplish in just ten short years. </p>\n<p>By the end of 2013, individuals and families throughout the region increased their giving by 19 percent, with $33 million in assets invested at their community foundation. With strong portfolio growth that year, more than $3.5 million in grants and scholarships were processed by 5.5 THCF staff. Fast forward ten years, and the growth in fundholder generosity should be celebrated. By the end of 2023, the THCF staff (now a team of six full-time and two part-time staff) processed more than $7.3 million in charitable grants and scholarships, and the foundation maintains approximately $85 million in assets. In what feels like a blink of an eye, THCF fundholders have doubled the amount of support to causes and charities. </p>\n<p>Education has consistently held a special place in the hearts of our community. THCF donors understand the significance of learning and consistently strive to prioritize it. Ten years ago, the foundation was working to grow the number of scholarships available and provide greater support to donors interested in this type of legacy. And grown it has, laying a foundation for a brighter tomorrow for literally thousands of students. At the end of 2023, more than $784,000 in scholarships were awarded to 349 students. That is a 350% increase in the annual award amount in just ten years. At this pace, the program will cross the $1 million threshold in the next few years – another testament to the generosity of the people in our communities and their continued dedication to supporting education over time.</p>\n<p>Scholarships are not the only way THCF fundholders have supported their communities over the years. The pool of funds used to offer competitive grants to nonprofits serving the area has more than doubled in the past ten years. In 2023, 62 competitive grants were awarded to 59 nonprofits totaling more than $450,000. Like our scholarship funds, competitive grants continue to see growth as more and more donors include this unique charitable opportunity in their legacy planning.</p>\n<p>That is what a community foundation is all about – helping generous people figure out the best ways to be generous. Over the years, many fundholders have come to have a deeper appreciation for the foundation's mission. Ten years ago, there were 95 members of the Heartland Legacy Society, a group of people who included a fund at THCF in their will or other planned giving vehicles. Today, the Heartland Legacy Society is closing in on 200 members. THCF is in an even better position to help individuals and families create positive change through philanthropy today and for years to come. </p>\n<p>Time is strange – sometimes, it seems to drag on like the last day of school, and other times it's over in a flash. It's important to take a moment, here and there, to recognize and appreciate how far we've all come and then consider what's next. Where do you want to be ten years from now? What impact do you want to have? What legacy do you want to leave? </p>\n<p>Don't blink; you might miss it.</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn how to make a difference with a named scholarship fund, contact our Director of Scholarships, <a href=\"mailto:watkins@thcf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rachael Watkins</a>, at (816) 912-4185 to learn more. <a href=\"mailto:castillo@thcf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Diana Castillo</a>, Director of Grants and Donor Services, would be happy to talk you through the competitive grants process.

A critical aspect of financial planning is looking ahead to retirement.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p> Whether your retirement is happening in 2024 or 20-24 years from now, planning for all the different aspects of retirement is an essential part of life for almost every working adult. And the earlier you start, the better off you'll be. </p>\n<p>Don't overlook the importance of planning for continued philanthropy during your retirement. For individuals who want to maintain their charitable giving in retirement and beyond, a donor advised fund (DAF) at your community foundation is a flexible and tax-smart option. You can contribute cash, appreciated stocks, real estate, or other complex assets to your fund and receive a tax deduction in the year the contribution is made. From your DAF account, you can then distribute grants to support the charities and causes that matter most to you when the timing is right for you. By investing in your fund and allowing the principle to grow, you can ensure you will be able to support your favorite charities throughout your retirement. </p>\n<p>If you're looking to support your favorite organizations but would also appreciate receiving a steady flow of income during your retirement, a Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) might be an option worth considering. This type of investment allows you to contribute appreciated assets, generate a fixed stream of income, defer or eliminate gains, and reduce inheritance taxes all at the same time. As a bonus, your community foundation will manage all the administrative aspects for you, leaving you more time to do the things you enjoy. At the time of your passing, the \"remainder\" of your trust is passed into your fund, which will continue to support the charitable causes you named in your documentation. This means that you can continue to support your favorite charities and leave a lasting legacy of generosity and support. Overall, a CRT can be an excellent way to support the causes that you care about while also generating income for yourself. </p>\n<p>Exactly how much you'll need for your giving in retirement is entirely unique to you. One way to gain confidence in your plans to retire is by knowing what to set aside for things like daily expenses, healthcare, home repairs, charitable giving, recreation, and the unexpected. Having professional support during the planning process and over the course of your retirement can be invaluable. Retirement planning can be an intimidating and complex process, but with the right advice and guidance, you can be confident that you are making the most of your resources and setting yourself up for a comfortable and philanthropic retirement. </p>\n<p>If you're interested in learning more about these options or would like professional support during your planning process, consider reaching out to a professional financial advisor. Cole Eason, Truman Heartland Community Foundation's Vice President of Advancement, would be pleased to talk with you about planning for continued philanthropy during your retirement and can be reached at 816-912-4182 or <a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org\">eason@thcf.org</a>. Remember, the earlier you start planning, the more prepared you'll be when it's your time to retire. </p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

(December 21, 2023) – Truman Heartland Community Foundation (THCF) invites students of all ages to apply for more than $800,000 in scholarships for the 2024-2025 school year beginning December 15, 2023. Students can submit one general scholarship application that will match them with more than 50 scholarships they may be qualified to receive. Once matched to scholarships, additional documentation such as transcripts with final Fall 2023 grades, essays, letters of reference, or statements about participation in certain activities may be required. The deadline to submit the general scholarship application and any supplemental materials is April 1, 2024. Visit www.thcf.org/students/scholarships to learn more and begin the application process.</p>\n<p>The timeline for THCF’s general scholarship application for 2024-2025 is later than normal due to changes being made to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the U.S. Department of Education. THCF utilizes the FAFSA’s findings about applicants’ financial need in awarding many of its scholarships. The new, simplified FAFSA is scheduled to launch by December 31, 2023, more than two months later than usual. Visit www.mofafsa.org to learn more about the FAFSA changes and get current updates.</p>\n<p>\"Whether you are a graduating high school senior, a current college student, or an adult looking to go back to school and finish your degree, chances are there is a scholarship at the foundation available for you,\" said Rachael Watkins, Director of Scholarships at THCF. \"We encourage everyone seeking higher education to apply for scholarships.\" </p>\n<p>Some scholarships have separate stand-alone applications, and their deadlines and requirements vary. We encourage students to apply for each scholarship for which they are eligible.</p>\n<p>In 2023, Truman Heartland awarded more than $784,000 in scholarships to 349 local students. Since 1982, THCF has awarded more than $6.7 million to help students reach their educational goals.

Truman Heartland Community Foundation (THCF) has been at the forefront of philanthropy in the region for 41 years. So far this year, just over 300 Truman Heartland Community Foundation fundholders have contributed more than $2 million in funding to all kinds of nonprofit organizations. December is traditionally the biggest month for giving, so we expect to see a significant increase in donations over the next four weeks. From Raytown to Raymore, Englewood to Oak Grove, the thoughtful generosity of our friends and neighbors is heartening.<br></p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Grants/Grants-Luncheons/_smallBodyImage/IMG_2216.jpg\" alt=\"four young people playing instruments\"><figcaption>2023-24 Competitive Grant Recipient - Music Arts Institute</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Earlier in November, we hosted our 28th Annual <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/grant-seekers/past-recipients\">Competitive Grants</a> Luncheon, awarding $453,733 in competitive grants to 59 local nonprofit agencies. The funding for these grants mainly comes from endowed funds set up through donor estate gifts. Just over $30,000 in additional funding was provided through the generosity of current Truman Heartland fundholders, the THCF Youth Advisory Council endowment fund, and the Junior Service League. Competitive grants help nonprofit organizations serving suburban Eastern Jackson and Cass County communities by providing much-needed programs and project funding. </p>\n<p>The volunteers who served on the THCF Grants Committee spent countless hours over the summer and fall reviewing all 126 grant proposals in detail. It would be impossible for the foundation to do this work without the dedicated support of these community volunteers. If you see any of these people out and about town, please thank them for all they do. Led by Allan Thompson as Chair, the 2023 THCF Grants Committee included Cathy Allie, Ted Bowman, Rev. Aaron Brown, Dr. Robert Cordell, Beth Franklin, Ryan Gibson, Nancy Griego, Lori Halsey, Liesl Hays, Damon Hodges, Mayor Mike Larson, Dave Mayta, Ritchie Momon, Joe Mullins, Steve Noll, Tom Rohr, Merideth Rose, Dr. Beth Rosemergey, DeeAnn Stock, Trish Totta, and Dr. Joy Vann-Hamilton. </p>\n<p>During the Competitive Grants Luncheon event, there were several members present from THCF's <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/donors/heartland-legacy-society\">Legacy Society</a>, which is comprised of individuals who have generously included the Foundation in their estate plans. These new members were recognized for their deep commitment to philanthropy and their legacy of giving back to the community: Bob Glaser, Gerald Rooker, Brent Schondelmeyer &amp; Lee Williams, John &amp; Karen Schuler, and Lennie Wyre. The luncheon provided an opportunity for the foundation to acknowledge and thank these individuals for their generous support. Their contributions and foresight have helped to ensure that the Foundation will continue to make a positive impact on our communities for years to come.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Grants/Grants-Banners/_largeBodyImage/Legacy-Society-2023.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Legacy Society Members\"><figcaption>2023 Legacy Society Members in attendance at the 2023 Grants Luncheon</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As you soak up the warm glow of twinkling lights and holiday cheer over the coming weeks, take a moment to thank someone you know—someone who makes a habit of doing amazing things for their community. For decades, our foundation fundholders have been creating positive change by providing millions of dollars in funding through competitive community grants, educational scholarships, field-of-interest funds, and more. Their work has transformed the lives of countless individuals, families, and organizations throughout our Eastern Jackson County community and beyond. For all that they do, I am truly thankful. By working together, we can create a better world for all of us to live, work, and serve, not just during the holidays but for generations to come.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

This year, THCF received more than $1.1 million in grant requests from local nonprofits seeking funding for projects and programs impacting Eastern Jackson and Cass County communities. However, THCF only has $413,199 available through endowed community grantmaking funds to award. Grant awards will be presented at a special luncheon on Thursday, November 9, 2023, at Adams Pointe Conference Center located at 1400 NE Coronado Drive in Blue Springs, Missouri, beginning at 11:00 a.m.</p>\n<p>In addition to the grants provided by endowed funds held at THCF, the Foundation’s current fundholders and other partners are given the opportunity to “Fill the Gap” and provide additional funding for grants that were approved by the Foundation’s Grants Committee but were not able to be fully funded at the level requested. This year, more than $40,000 was added to the competitive grant pool, increasing the total amount of funding provided to $453,733. </p>\n<p>\"I am always heartened by the generosity of our fundholders,\" explains Diana Castillo, THCF Director of Grants and Donor Services. \"Each year, I have a number of them chomping at the bit for our <em>Fill the Gap</em> list to be published so they can see which organizations they can give to and help them reach their goal. The looks of surprise on the nonprofit staff member's faces at the Luncheon when they realize they are getting a bigger grant check than they thought, it is just so moving.\"</p>\n<p>The THCF Grants Luncheon brings together community leaders, local businesses, and nonprofit organizations to celebrate the power of giving and recognize the impact of philanthropy. THCF offers two types of competitive grants each year: The Jelley Family Foundation Endowment for Children's Education and Community Grants. Jelley Family Foundation grants focus on children’s education, whereas Community Grants address arts, culture, and historic preservation; adult or non-traditional education; community betterment; health and human services; and wildlife conservation in Missouri. Grant funding enables nonprofit organizations serving the area to continue and expand their much-needed services.</p>\n<p>A very special thank you goes out to all the individuals who gave up countless hours of their personal time to review each of the grant applications received by THCF. Led by Allan Thompson as Chair, the THCF Grants Committee was committed to its task. Thank you to all those who participated in this mammoth annual effort: Cathy Allie, Ted Bowman, Rev. Aaron Brown, Dr. Robert Cordell, Beth Franklin, Ryan Gibson, Nancy Griego, Lori Halsey, Liesl Hays, Damon Hodges, Mayor Mike Larson, Dave Mayta, Ritchie Momon, Joe Mullins, Steve Noll, Tom Rohr, Merideth Rose, Dr. Beth Rosemergey, DeeAnn Stock, Trish Totta, and Dr. Joy Vann-Hamilton.

This past summer, Alexis and Will looked forward to getting married and combining their two households into one. The one thing they did not want (or need) was more stuff, as they had more than enough mixing bowls, candle holders, and gravy boats to go around. So instead of a traditional gift, Alexis’ parents, Bridget McCandless and Dennis Taylor, decided to set the newlyweds up with a donor advised fund (DAF) at Truman Heartland Community Foundation.</p>\n<p>A DAF is a charitable giving vehicle that will allow the couple to make donations to nonprofit organizations but retain the right to advise on how the funds are used. It's a great way for anyone to support the causes they are passionate about while receiving some nice tax benefits. Because Alexis and Will live in another state, their new DAF allows them to give to any nonprofit organization they want to support, locally or in their own hometown. And if they are not sure where to give, THCF can help them find the causes and agencies that address issues that are important them. </p>\n<p>One of the primary benefits of using a donor advised fund is that it really simplifies charitable giving. You can make one large donation to the DAF, like in our example here of a wedding gift, and then the DAF holder can distribute those funds to multiple charities over whatever time frame works for them. Plus, with a DAF, you don't have to track down all your donation receipts at tax time. Fundholders receive statements from the foundation, making itemizing returns much easier and less time-consuming.</p>\n<p>Another benefit of using a DAF is that it provides flexibility in how you give. You can donate cash, stocks, or other appreciated assets to a DAF, which can help maximize your tax benefits. Additionally, donor advised funds allow you to donate anonymously, which can be helpful if you want to keep your giving private.</p>\n<p>DAFs also provide a way to involve your entire family in philanthropy. You can name your children, grandchildren, or other family members as advisors to th</p>\n<p>e fund, which can help instill a sense of giving in the next generation. It's a great way to teach your family about the importance of giving back to the community. Bridget and Dennis had a fund with THCF for many years, so the idea of philanthropy wasn't new to Alexis. And now that she and her new partner have their own fund, they can keep the legacy of giving going for the next generation. </p>\n<p>A donor-advised fund is a unique and meaningful gift that can support the causes a couple cares about while also providing the gift giver with some nice tax benefits. It simplifies the process of charitable giving, provides flexibility in the timing of gifts, and can involve the entire family in the process of philanthropy. It's a great way to make a difference in the world and celebrate a special occasion. If you're looking for a wedding, graduation, or other life-celebration gift for someone who already has everything they need, giving a DAF might be the perfect option.</p><figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2023/_largeBodyImage/best-wedding-gifts.png\" alt=\"Wedding gift wrapped in brown paper\"></figure>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

However, did you know donating your life insurance policy to charity is a decision that can provide numerous benefits for both you and the charity you support?</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>By gifting your policy to a Truman Heartland Community Foundation fund, you can significantly impact the work of your favorite charities and support their missions for years to come. </p>\n<p>If you own a life insurance policy that is already paid for and is no longer necessary for your family's needs, or if you have more insurance coverage than your family requires, consider transferring the policy's ownership to your charitable fund at THCF. You can also leave instructions to create a new fund if you don't have one already. This way, you can make a generous contribution while also receiving an immediate tax deduction for the approximate cash surrender value of the policy. Moreover, you can deduct future premium payments made to THCF as outright gifts.</p>\n<p>You may also retain ownership of the policy and name THCF as the beneficiary of your policy. You can also choose to designate THCF as a partial, full, or contingent beneficiary of your life insurance policy. By doing so, you will still own the policy and can use it during your lifetime. It's best to consult with your financial advisor or tax professional to determine the best course of action for your specific situation. And, of course, your friends at THCF are always happy to answer any questions you may have. </p>\n<p>Overall, donating your life insurance policy to set up a permanent fund at THCF is a great way to make meaningful contributions to your favorite causes.

Not only is December a critical time for many nonprofits to meet their financial goals, but smart planning now can yield significant tax benefits come year-end. With so many deserving causes out there, it's important to explore all your options to ensure that you're making the most of your tax savings while supporting the organizations and causes that matter most to you.</p>\n<p>One popular way to save for retirement is through an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). This type of account allows you to invest funds that grow tax-free until you withdraw them during retirement. But did you know that your IRA can also be a powerful tool for your charitable giving? If you're over the age of 70 ½, you can make a Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) from your IRA directly to a charitable organization. This is a tax-wise way to give, as the QCD counts towards your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD), and you won't pay taxes on the withdrawal. It's a smart way to avoid income tax on withdrawals from your IRA while supporting your favorite charities.</p>\n<p>Another effective way to maximize your charitable impact is to donate appreciated non-cash assets such as stocks. By donating the asset, rather than donating the proceeds from the asset's sale, you can eliminate capital gains tax on the gift and get an itemized deduction for the value of the donation. This is a win-win for you and your charity of choice. </p>\n<p>If you're looking for a more structured approach to your charitable giving, you may want to consider a Donor Advised Fund (DAF). With a DAF, you can make tax-deductible contributions of cash or non-cash assets at any time, not just at the end of the year. Community Foundations are uniquely positioned to accept many different gifts to establish a DAF, including appreciated securities, cryptocurrency, and real estate. Plus, all donations to DAFs made by December 31 are eligible for a 2023 tax deduction. Once your DAF is established (with as little as a $5,000 initial contribution), you can start making grants immediately or wait until the timing is right for you. And if you manage all your charitable giving through your DAF, the only receipts you need at tax time are for the gifts into your fund. You won’t have to track down tax receipts from multiple charities to give to your tax preparer.</p>\n<p>With the standard deduction for 2023 of $27,700 (married filing jointly), 90 percent of taxpayers cannot itemize their deductions. If you are in this category, another strategy to save on taxes and assist with year-end tax planning is utilizing a charitable bunching strategy with your DAF. Charitable bunching is when you group the contributions you intend to make over a period of years into one large donation to a Donor Advised Fund (DAF). In the year you make your \"bunched\" donation, you will be able to itemize your tax return and enjoy a larger deduction. In the years you do not bunch contributions, you will continue to make regular donations to your favorite charities through your DAF and claim the standard deduction on your taxes. This method allows you to continue to support your favorite charities while maximizing the tax benefit of your charitable contributions.</p>\n<p>Planning your year-end donations is a great way to kick off the holiday season. Many organizations truly depend on these donations, with December giving accounting for roughly 26 percent of annual nonprofit revenue. By utilizing tools like your IRA, a Donor Advised Fund, charitable bunching strategies, and more, you can maximize the impact of your year-end philanthropy while minimizing your taxes. Talk to your financial advisor to find out if there is something more you can do. Remember, smart planning now can help you make the most of your donations and ensure a brighter future for the causes closest to your heart.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

As part of their grant review process, these students visit nonprofits that have submitted youth-focused grant proposals to the Foundation. This summer, eight teams of YAC students participated in 16 separate nonprofit site visits.<br></p>\n<p>These visits are an essential aspect of the YAC grant review process, as they allow students to ask clarifying questions about the proposals, get a better feel for the agency's mission, and see firsthand what they are trying to accomplish and how. As part of their YAC experience, students learn what aspects to consider as they review grant proposals and tour facilities. </p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/YAC/_smallBodyImage/IMG20230817194451.jpg\" alt=\"Student speaking at mic\"><figcaption>Chris presents to his YAC peers.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>After the site visits are completed, the students create detailed presentations to share their experiences with their fellow YAC members. Each school decides as a group whether to fund the grant proposal in full, partially, or not at all. Because YAC has its own endowed fund, students also get to choose what project(s) their annual donation will support. </p>\n<p>This year, YAC grants will be split between three organizations that were not fully funded with a standard competitive grant: Cancer Action, TNC Community, and Necessity Pantry At St. Michael's Episcopal Church. YAC representatives from each school also present their findings to the Foundation’s Community Grants Committee, who then use the information provided by the YAC members to guide their grant funding decisions. </p>\n<p>The grant review process is one of the most unique parts of YAC and is repeatedly brought up for its ability to make students feel empowered.

That's where the Foundation’s Job Skills for New Careers initiative comes in.</p>\n<p>This collaborative community initiative, launched in early 2020, is focused on helping adults gain the skills they need to succeed in in-demand careers like Certified Nursing Assistants, Computer Support Specialists, EKG technicians, CDL drivers, Phlebotomy technicians, and many, many more. By utilizing adult education funding available through numerous local programs, individuals can gain critical career skills that can make a remarkable impact on their lives in the long term without going into debt.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Job-Skills/_smallBodyImage/iStock-178088241.jpg\" alt=\"truck driving training\"></figure><figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Job-Skills/_smallBodyImage/welding.png\" alt=\"welding\"></figure><figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Job-Skills/_smallBodyImage/nursing.png\" alt=\"Nursing training\"></figure>\n<p>What sets Job Skills for New Careers apart from other education programs is the comprehensive wrap-around services made possible through the financial support of our fundholders. Provided by our partners at Community Services League, these critical services support program participants with everything from utilities and rent assistance, purchasing scrubs and stethoscopes for the first day of work, to offering personal finance coaching and resume writing. These critical programs and services are provided on a case-by-case basis and allow people to navigate beyond life's barriers to achieve their career goals.</p>\n<p>The success rate of Job Skills for New Careers is truly impressive. In 2020, 53 individuals completed training programs. This year, more than 200 individuals are expected to complete their certificate programs and will be well on their way to a better career and life for themselves and their families. They will go far in new careers that pay living wages and are proven to be in high demand in the region.</p>\n<p>One of the key factors contributing to the success of Job Skills for New Careers is its collaborative approach. With organizations like Community Services League, Mid-Continent Public Library, KC Scholars, the University of Central Missouri, the Independence Council for Economic Development, and the Mid-America Regional Council, Job Skills for New Careers offers a pathway to success at every level, from high school GED to landing that dream job. By working together, our partners can offer a wide variety of readily available solutions to some of the most common barriers to adult learning.</p>\n<p>KC Scholars received a $50 million grant from The Kauffman Foundation to provide adult-learning tuition assistance, and they have lofty goals for participation and completion rates. KC Scholars provides tuition assistance for approved training programs that lead to careers with salaries between $45,000 and $85,000. More than 60% of our participants will have their tuition paid by KC Scholars through the Great Jobs KC program.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Job-Skills/_largeBodyImage/Wrap-Around-Services-Sample-WEB.png\" alt=\"Examples of wrap-around services like work boots, gift cards, and grocery assistance\"></figure>\n<p>The Truman Heartland Community Foundation fundholders also play a critical role in the success of Job Skills for New Careers.

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n        <p class=\"largetext\">As summer is winding down, many of us are looking ahead for ways to give back and make a difference in our communities. Charitable bunching is a financial strategy that can help you maximize the impact of your donations while also providing you with some tax benefits.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>So, what is <a href=\"https://d2f39dzk9sbfur.cloudfront.net/documents/Right-3-Bunching-1Sheet-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">charitable bunching</a>? It's a simple concept that involves combining several years' worth of charitable donations into a single year. By doing this, you can exceed the standard deduction threshold and itemize your deductions, which can result in significant tax savings.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you typically donate $9,000 to charity each year. Under the current tax laws, you would likely take the standard deduction of $13,850 for a single filer or $27,700 for a married couple filing jointly. However, if you were to bunch your donations over three years and give $27,000 to charity in a single year, you would exceed the standard deduction threshold and be able to itemize your deductions. This could potentially save you more than $17,000 of dollars in taxes every third year.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://d2f39dzk9sbfur.cloudfront.net/documents/Right-3-Bunching-1Sheet-2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2023/_largeBodyImage/DAF-Bunching.png?1693498312262\" alt=\"DAF with and without bunching graph\"></a></figure>\n<p>But the benefits of charitable bunching go beyond just tax savings. By utilizing your DAF to manage your charitable giving, you can simplify both your donation process and the amount of paperwork you have to organize at tax time. Plus, because you have flexibility in the timing of your gifts, you may be able to manage a larger gift that can be used to support a specific project, campaign, or initiative. </p>\n\n<p>Your Financial Advisor or your friends at the Foundation can explain how charitable bunching allows you to be more intentional with your giving. We take the time to research and confirm that the organizations you want to donate to align with your values, are valid 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations, and are actively working to make a significant impact in your community. We can help you do more good, with a lot less effort. </p>\n<p>Overall, charitable bunching is a smart strategy for anyone looking to donate to charity on a regular basis. By combining several years' worth of donations into a single year, you can have a greater impact on the organizations you support and save money on your taxes. So, as you plan your charitable giving with your financial advisor, consider the benefits of a DAF bunching strategy and learn how it may help you make a more significant impact in your community.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

However, it's important to have this conversation to ensure that their wishes are respected and their memory is honored in the way they want.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p><a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/news/your-family-letter-an-important-part-of-your-estate-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phil's article</a> highlights a crucial component of estate planning - the family letter. This document serves to communicate your wishes to your loved ones and provide them with all the necessary information they need to carry out your legacy. However, putting all your thoughts and intentions on paper can be daunting. It might be easier to initiate the conversation with your family members first.</p>\n<p>It's important to approach the conversation with empathy and compassion. Your loved one may be feeling a range of emotions, including fear, sadness, and regret, so it's important to be patient and understanding.</p>\n<p>Start the conversation by asking your loved one what they want their legacy to be. This can be a difficult question to ask, but it's important to give them the opportunity to share their wishes. Listen carefully to their answer and ask follow-up questions to ensure that you truly understand what they want.</p>\n<p>If your loved one is struggling to articulate their wishes, offer some suggestions to get them started. For example, you could suggest creating a family tree, writing a family letter, or creating a photo album. These activities can help your loved one feel like they're leaving a lasting legacy and can also be a meaningful way for you to remember them.</p>\n<p>Be sure to express your love and gratitude to your loved one. Let them know how much they mean to you and how you will cherish their memory after they're gone. This can be a difficult conversation, but it's also an opportunity to connect with your loved one on a deeper level and celebrate their life.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Admin_Misc/_smallBodyImage/noun_Hearts_2468293_Grn.jpg\" alt=\"green heart shape\"></figure>\n<p><strong>Here are some questions and ideas to help start the conversation:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What local or global issues do you think are most important?</li><li>Tell me about the organizations you regularly donate to and their mission.</li><li>What do you believe is the biggest problem in our community, and how would you solve it if given the chance?</li><li>How would you like people to remember you?</li><li>What kind of legacy would you like to leave behind for your community?</li><li>What matters to you most when it comes to making an impact on the world?</li><li>What charities or causes do you give your time to, and what drives you to be a volunteer?</li><li>How would you like your children/grandchildren/siblings to participate in your philanthropy?</li><li>What advice would you give someone who wants to make a positive impact but doesn't know where to start?</li></ol>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

Founded by the Foundation in 1998, YAC is often referred to as our \"school of philanthropy\" due to its unique approach to community betterment.</p>\n<p>Unlike other extracurricular activities that prioritize competition or athleticism, YAC members take an active role in making a positive difference in their community. It's not about winning or beating someone </p>\n<p>else; for YAC members, it's about feeling good about doing good. Collaboration over competition. One of the most notable projects for YAC members is the annual food drive, which benefits local food pantries and ensures that those in need have access to essential resources. Additionally, YAC hosts an annual fundraiser to raise funds for their endowment fund. The more money they raise, the more they can give back to the community through community grants. What sets YAC apart is that </p>\n<p>the members collectively decide which organizations to support and how much to donate. This provides students with a hands-on approach to philanthropy and shows them how their actions are making a real impact in their community.</p><figure class=\"caption left\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/YAC/_smallBodyImage/IMG20230817194451.jpg\" alt=\"YAC student giving a presentation\"><figcaption>YAC students present about their site visits. </figcaption></figure>\n<p>YAC student leaders are truly involved in making a difference in their community. Not only do they raise funds for their own grantmaking, but they also get to play a pivotal role in the Foundation's competitive grants program. During their summer break, our YAC students visit various local nonprofit organizations that have applied for a community grant. They then present their site-visit findings to their peers and the grants committee for consideration. It's remarkable how these students get to influence these funding decisions, aiming to promote programs that best serve the needs of the community.</p>\n<p>But YAC isn't just about attending meetings and events – it's about actively contributing to a greater cause. Members have the opportunity to work alongside other motivated students from schools all across Eastern Jackson County, including Blue Springs, Fort Osage, Lee's Summit, Raytown, Truman, Grain Valley, and more! This means that YAC members will not only make a difference in their own communities but also build valuable connections with students from other schools.</p>\n<p>As the school year begins, YAC leaders and members are excited to welcome new members to their teams. This is a non-competitive philanthropic activity that's all about making a difference in your community. So, if you or someone you know is looking for a way to get involved and make a positive impact, YAC is the perfect fit. Don't miss out on this exciting opportunity to become a part of something special and leave a lasting impact on our Eastern Jackson County community!</p><figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/YAC/Senior-Picnic/_largeBodyImage/20230817_193613.jpg\" alt=\"Group of YAC students standing in a line\"></figure>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Headshots/Staff/_smallThumbnail/Diana-WEB.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" loading=\"lazy\">\n        <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Have questions about Youth Advisory Council?</h2>      <p>Diana Castillo is here to help!</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:castillo@thcf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Email Diana</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

However, there is another key component that is often overlooked: the family letter. </p>\n<p>A family letter is a personal document that allows you to communicate your wishes, thoughts, and feelings to your loved ones. It can be a valuable tool for your family members during a difficult time, as it provides important information and guidance on a variety of topics that are important to both you and your loved ones. </p>\n<p>One of the main benefits of a family letter is that it allows you to express your gratitude and appreciation to your family members. This can be especially meaningful for those who may not have heard those words from you before. A family letter can also be an opportunity to apologize, forgive, or reconcile with family members. If there are any unresolved issues or conflicts within your family, a family letter can provide a safe space for you to address them. By acknowledging past mistakes and expressing your desire for a better relationship, you can help to heal old wounds and strengthen your family bonds.</p>\n<p>In terms of practical information, a family letter can cover a wide range of topics. For example, it can include details about your estate planning choices, such as who your attorney and financial advisors are and where your important documents are located. It can also list all your assets and financial information, as well as any online accounts and passwords. </p>\n<p>Another important aspect of a family letter is the inclusion of family history. This can provide valuable context for your loved ones and help them understand their own place within the family. Additionally, a family letter can include information about your wishes for the care of children, grandchildren, or pets, as well as any memberships or other obligations you may have. </p>\n<p>Your family letter can also include your final words of wisdom or a blessing for your friends and family. This is a powerful way to leave a lasting impression on those you care about most. </p>\n<p>A family letter is an important part of every estate plan, regardless of the size of the estate. It allows you to fully communicate your wishes and feelings to your loved ones, while also providing practical information and guidance. If you still need to create a family letter, now is the time. Your family will thank you for it.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

Here are some common concepts to consider when making a beneficiary designation.</p>\n<p><strong>Beneficiary designations</strong> are often used to name beneficiaries of retirement plans or life insurance policies. By filling out a form provided by your financial institution or advisor, you can name a <strong>primary beneficiary</strong> (usually a spouse) who will receive the balance of your accounts or policies if they outlive you. You can also name <strong>partial contingent beneficiaries</strong>, such as your children, grandchildren, or nonprofits, to receive shares or percentages of the account or policy if the primary beneficiary has passed away.</p>\n<p>You may come across the terms POD and TOD. <strong>POD</strong> stands for \"payable on death\" and is typically used when designating a beneficiary for a checking account, savings account, or certificate of deposit. <strong>TOD</strong>, or \"transfer on death,\" is often used when designating a beneficiary for stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.</p>\n<p>In some states, including Missouri, you can use \"<strong>beneficiary designation deeds</strong>\" or \"transfer on death deeds\" for real estate. These deeds allow you to name a survivor beneficiary for your home, farm, or other real estate and can help your property avoid probate.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2023/_largeBodyImage/infographic-beneficiary-designation.jpg\" alt=\"Designation infographic\"></figure>\n<p>Remember, most beneficiary gifts can be changed or revoked simply by filling out a new beneficiary designation form or revocation form. So, as your life circumstances change, so can your beneficiary designations.</p>\n<p>Beneficiary designation gifts can be a simple and effective way to provide for your loved ones, and support causes that matter to you. It's important to understand the common concepts associated with beneficiary designations. It’s also important to remember to review and update your beneficiary designations as needed to ensure that your wishes are accurately reflected in your financial and estate plans.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

So, what is this magical employment tool? </p>\n<p>It's belonging.</p>\n<p>According to Gallup, if managers increase the number of employees who feel their opinions matter, they could achieve these gains and more. It's about creating a culture where everyone's differences and contributions are genuinely appreciated. That's what THCF is striving for with our employees and our volunteer leadership.</p>\n<p>In the workplace, <strong>diversity</strong> encompasses the range of similarities and differences everyone brings to the table. This includes national origin, race, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, and mental and physical ability, among others. <strong>Equity</strong> is about ensuring fair treatment, access, and advancement for each person in an organization. <strong>Inclusion</strong> in the workplace means that employees feel welcomed and valued by the people and environment around them for who they are. Finally, <strong>belonging</strong> means that employees actively want to bring their true selves to work because they know it will be celebrated and admired. </p>\n<p>Each aspect of DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging) is important, and we understand that these four pillars work together as one cohesive strategy. If one falls, they will all come crashing down. THCF is actively working to create a diverse, inclusive, and equitable business where everyone, staff, volunteers, donors, and community members, feel like they belong. </p>\n<p>Fostering a culture of belonging isn't just the right thing to do; it's also a smart business strategy. By prioritizing DEIB, THCF will be a stronger organization and make a bigger impact in our community. It's up to business leaders to recognize the importance of these pillars and work towards creating an environment where everyone feels welcomed and valued for who they are. Together, we can create a more equitable and inclusive place right here in Eastern Jackson County.</p><figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2023/_largeBodyImage/dei_progress_hero.width-1200.format-webp.jpg\" alt=\"DEI = Belonging\"></figure>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

But did you know that you can also use your IRA to make a charitable donation? </p>\n<p>If you have an IRA, a charitable rollover could make a big difference in your community. In January of this year, as part of the Secure Act 2.0, some of the IRA rules changed. For instance, the age at which you are required to make a minimum distribution (RMD) from your IRA increased from 70 ½ to 73 years old. Individuals older than 70 ½ can donate up to $100,000 to qualified charities directly from their IRA, while in the case of a married couple filing jointly, each may contribute up to $100,000 from their IRA. In addition, the annual IRA QCD (qualified charitable deduction) limit of $100,000 will be indexed for inflation, effective for tax years after 2023. And although this is good for charitable donors, there were no changes in QDC restrictions, and, unfortunately, QCDs continue to be ineligible for donation into donor advised funds (DAF). You are still able to put your QDCs into a scholarship fund or designated fund at the Community Foundation. </p>\n<figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://d2f39dzk9sbfur.cloudfront.net/images/News/_largeBodyImage/636643942202141206-GettyImages-515836063.jpg\" alt=\"Charity jar\"></figure>\n<p>The January changes also include a one-time election for a QCD to a split-interest entity. This gives donors the ability to make a QCD of up to $50,000 to fund one of either a Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT), Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT), or Charitable Gift Annuity (CGA).</p>\n<p>Utilizing your IRA to make charitable donations can be a smart way to give back to your community while also securing your retirement funds. With the recent changes in the law, it's important to stay informed about the rules and regulations surrounding charitable rollovers from an IRA. By doing so, you can ensure that your charitable giving strategy aligns with your financial goals and helps make a positive impact throughout the region.

They strive to make their community a better place because that’s what people <strong>should</strong> do.

Throughout his time in the community, John has also volunteered for various projects, including the Lake Tapawingo Community Advisory Project in 2004 and a task force to study building a new joint City Hall/Country Club Office complex in 2008. He has also advocated for property tax increases to finance a general obligation bond to replace the water system and restore the city's financial stability. John's unwavering commitment to the Lake Tapawingo community has made a significant impact.</p>\n\n<h3>Oak Grove Citizen of the Year – Becky &amp; Randy Messer</h3>\n<p>Becky and Randy are unmistakable figures in their Oak Grove community.

He has been a vital member of the Sugar Creek City Council and an effective and efficient City Administrator. Additionally, Patrick helps organize the Red Bag Day event each year, which collects gifts for local children in need. He also participates in an annual fundraiser to support people impacted by Down Syndrome. Patrick's heart is full of compassion, and he has made a significant positive impact on the entire Sugar Creek community.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>A few weeks before the Gala, there will be a Citizens Reception where all nine local mayors will talk about the contributions of their citizens to their community. This is a private event sponsored by Centerpoint Medical Center, and we thank Drs.

We are incredibly proud of the continued growth of our family of funds and are pleased to see the community impact steadily grow. The same cannot be said, however, of giving nationally.</p>\n<p>According to<em> Giving USA 2023: The Annual Report on Philanthropy</em> study, after record giving for the last two years, total giving was down in 2022. With both the stock market and Bond market down, 2022 giving reflected the economic uncertainty felt by many donors. Overall, total giving was down 3.4 percent before inflation (down 10.5 percent when adjusted for inflation). And although giving to foundations was up 2.5 percent and corporate giving saw gains of 3.4 percent, they were not as impressive as the large gains made during the Covid years of 2020 and 2021. </p><figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2023/_largeBodyImage/givingusa_2023_Head.jpg\" alt=\"Giving USA state\"></figure>\n<p>Locally, we saw a lot of really positive growth in giving. There was a 20% increase in grants from our donor advised fundholders, a substantial increase. More than $6.3 million in grants and scholarships were distributed to students, nonprofits, and organizations throughout the region by THCF in 2022, a seven percent increase. </p>\n<p><strong>Our communities are some of the most generous in the country, and this data confirms that fact. </strong></p>\n<p>It also confirms the convenience and effectiveness of donor advised funds. Regardless of what the market is doing, individuals who utilize DAFs for their giving continue to make grants even when the market is down. They set their money aside for philanthropy, and it can be granted even in the most challenging economic times. As a matter of fact, a difficult economic market is often when thoughtful giving is needed most.</p>\n<p>Although giving was down last year in the US, it will come back. Giving USA’s historical data clearly demonstrates the ebb and flow of giving through the years, and it often rebounds from this type of decline. So as the markets and economy begin to settle down, so will giving. Until then, THCF will continue to invest wisely, be a good steward, offer personal support and service, and help you change the world through philanthropy!</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

On July 1, 1967, she married Charles \"Wayne\" Tibbets and worked as a substitute teacher until her son Scott was born. When Wayne was discharged from his Air Force service, the small family moved to Independence, Missouri.</p>\n<p>Daughter Kari was then born, and the Tibbetts became a Midwest family of four. Norma taught ESL and was a substitute teacher in the Independence School District, an active member of the PTA, a Cub Scout Den mother, and a Girl Scout leader. She even wrote a book of poetry entitled \"The Invisible Child.\" </p>\n<p>Norma was a devoted Independence First Christian Church member, serving as an elder and minister, Sunday School teacher, a member of the choir, and participated on numerous church committees. The people living and serving in the area were important to her, and she made time to give her time to help those in need. Norma advocated for hope as a pancreatic cancer survivor, regularly volunteering on the Bloch Cancer Foundation hotline.</p>\n<p>In 2001, after seeing a need, Norma established \"Tabitha's Closet,\" a clothing bank for students at Proctor Elementary School. Over time, Tabitha's Closet grew to serve all K-12 students in both Independence and Fort Osage School Districts, providing five complete outfits (including shoes) to more than 2,000 children twice per year, every year.</p><figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2023/_largeBodyImage/ghows-MO-3dbe3ccb-e398-558e-e053-0100007fa3bb-39c4848b.png\" alt=\"Norma Tibbetts, left, and Patty Cox | Jeff Fox/The Examiner\"><figcaption>Norma Tibbetts, left, and Patty Cox volunteering at Tabitha's Closet | Jeff Fox/The Examiner</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Following her retirement in 2016, The Closet has continued to grow and thrive.

That finding is included in the 2023 Missouri Transfer of Wealth Study, released today by the Alliance of Missouri Community Foundations, of which Truman Heartland Community Foundation (THCF) is a member. The goal of the Alliance is to encourage Missouri residents to consider allocating at least 5% of the assets they will pass on after their lifetimes to benefit their communities and favorite charitable causes. </p>\n<p>If that happened, Missouri’s nonprofit and philanthropic organizations would receive more than $7.6 billion over the next ten years to supplement other public and private funding sources that support areas like human services, education, the arts, community amenities, historic preservation, and the environment, faith, youth, animal welfare, and more. Even if all that money were endowed, meaning a portion is spendable while the principal stays intact to grow over time, a payout of just 5% would create $383 million in new resources annually. </p>\n<p>The 2023 Transfer of Wealth Study was conducted for the Alliance by the Center for Civic Research and Innovation in St. Louis, Missouri. It uses a variety of data sources and demographic trends to estimate Missourians’ current net worth and the potential wealth to be transferred based on household size, life expectancy, and wealth distribution. The full study is available at <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/news/2023-tow-study\">https://www.thcf.org/news/2023-tow-study</a>. </p>\n<p>“The potential benefits to our communities and nonprofit sector would be staggering if Missourians adopted the ‘5% Solution’ to include their charitable intentions in their estate and financial planning,” Mary Hinde, leader of the AMCF and President and CEO of the Community Foundation of Northwest Missouri, based in St. Joseph, remarked. “Missourians are known for their ‘show-me’ determination. This study shows us what’s possible if we all give a little to support the greater good.”</p>\n<p>The 2023 study updates the original study from 2013. It notes demographic trends, including Missouri’s aging population, with a larger proportion of the population reaching retirement age, which increases the amount of wealth being transferred between generations. Missouri also is experiencing population loss in some areas, particularly rural counties. </p>\n<p>“Our Foundation serves suburban Jackson, Cass, and Lafayette County communities, where we are seeing slow but steady population growth,” Phil Hanson, President and CEO of Truman Heartland Community Foundation noted upon review of the report. “Over the next decade, THCF's service area has the potential to receive a $49.2 Million investment. Imagine what an investment like that could do to enhance local education, arts, social services, and more. Just 5% set aside for philanthropy would significantly enhance the quality of life for all individuals living, working, and serving in the region.”</p>\n\n\n<p>The AMCF encourages Missourians to talk to their families and financial advisors about their charitable intentions during their estate planning. Members of the Alliance work with donors and their advisors on how to achieve their intentions through the wide variety of fund types and other charitable tools available to fulfill their goals. </p>\n<p>###</p>\n<p><strong><em>About the AMCF</em></strong> <br>\n<em>The Alliance of Missouri Community Foundations was founded in 2012 to serve as a networking and collaboration resource for Missouri’s community foundations, which are regional public charitable foundations serving specific geographic areas.

When you donate property to a qualified charity or community foundation, you can deduct the property's fair market value from your income taxes.

Additionally, if you donate real estate that has appreciated in value, you can avoid paying capital gains taxes on the appreciation. This can result in even greater tax savings.</p>\n<p>Donating real estate can be a great way to leave a legacy. By donating property, you can ensure that your impact will be felt for years to come. Your donation can create an endowed fund and legacy of support for the causes or organizations making a real difference in your community.

Despite Emily’s exceptional care, the hotel suffered during the Civil War. As a new source of income, she invented a healing salve. She sold the salve throughout the area, and the stories of its healing power spread far and wide.</p>\n<p><strong>Hiram Young </strong>was another important black figure in the history of Independence. He was a successful businessman and entrepreneur, founding a wildly successful yoke and wagon manufacturing business catering to settlers heading west. In doing this, he cornered the market and became one of the wealthiest businessmen in Jackson County. Hiram's legacy lives on as a testament to his unwavering commitment to economic empowerment and equality.

His election was a significant milestone in the fight for civil rights and equality.</p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>Samuel Shepard</strong> was known as an expert craftsman in his day and was thus selected to hew the logs of the first Jackson County Courthouse in 1827. Samuel, along with two other enslaved men, Peter and Ben, built the courthouse at the intersection of Lynn and Lexington. After being born into slavery, Samuel escaped to freedom and lived out the rest of his 100+ years as a free man in Lawrence, Kansas. </p><figure class=\"caption full\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/News/2023/_largeBodyImage/Courthouse.jpg\" alt=\"Jackson County Courthouse 1827\"></figure>\n<p>The contributions of these important black figures should never be forgotten.

Community foundations bring together donors, community leaders, and nonprofit organizations to work collaboratively towards common goals such as improving education, supporting the arts, promoting health and wellness, and alleviating poverty. By pooling resources and knowledge, community foundations can make a significant impact on the lives of those they serve. As you know, Truman Heartland Community Foundation (THCF) strives to play a critical role in building strong, resilient, and vibrant communities throughout suburban Eastern Jackson, Cass, and Lafayette Counties.</p>\n<p>Our commitment to building a better community is unwavering. Beyond our usual donor services, the Foundation is committed to improving the lives of individuals and families in the community by supporting community-focused <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/about/strategic-initiatives\">strategic initiatives</a>: issues and problems that impact the lives of our friends and neighbors. </p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Job-Skills/_smallBodyImage/iStock-1295597467.jpg\" alt=\"Taking blood\"><figcaption>Helping hard-working adults learn new skills</figcaption></figure>\n<p>One of our key initiatives is <em><a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/about/strategic-initiatives/job-skills-for-new-careers\">Job Skills for New Careers</a></em>, which aims to help hard-working adults develop the skills needed to obtain employment in a job that pays a living wage and has a career path. The Foundation has teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.cslcares.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Community Services League</a> and their <a href=\"https://www.cslcares.org/newskills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New Skills</a> program to provide (at no cost to the trainee) high-quality training and resources to help people identify and pursue new career paths. THCF fundholders donated more than $200,000 in 2022 to help provide critical support for the program. This includes wrap-around support services provided by Community Services League, such as personal finance and career coaching, gas cards, and utility assistance. The availability of comprehensive wrap-around services removes many of the common barriers that can prevent someone from successfully completing the training. Since 2020, nearly 300 people have completed the program, receiving industry-recognized certifications in high-demand career fields.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/YAC/Strike-in-the-Night/_smallBodyImage/IMG20230401193246.jpg\" alt=\"YAC students at their fundraiser\"><figcaption>YAC students at this year's Strike in the Night fundraiser</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Another important THCF initiative is the <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/about/strategic-initiatives/youth-advisory-council\">Youth Advisory Council</a> (YAC), our “School of Philanthropy.” YAC is designed to empower young people to become civic leaders and make a positive impact in their communities. YAC members engage in a variety of activities, such as volunteering, fundraising, grantmaking, and community service projects. Through this unique program, students from several local high schools have the opportunity to gain valuable leadership skills and make meaningful connections with other local students. Usually, when students from different high schools come together, it’s all about competition, whether that’s in sports, speech, debate, or scholar bowl, for example. Here the focus is coming together to build a better community. It’s a unique opportunity. </p>\n<p>Our commitment to the community is strong. By putting energy into our strategic initiatives with the support of our fundholders, THCF is truly making a difference in the lives of individuals and families in the community. Together, if we remain focused and stay the course, we can all work towards building stronger and more vibrant communities. I would be happy to sit down with anyone who would like to learn more about THCF’s community initiatives and ways you can get involved. Give the THCF office a call at 816-836-8189, and <a href=\"mailto:hanson@thcf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">let’s schedule a time</a> to meet.

A common one is to help make college education accessible and affordable for everyone. Establishing a scholarship is also an excellent way to support your professional industry, field of study, or alma mater or to honor the memory of a loved one. Whatever the reason for establishing a scholarship, once you have made the decision, there are five important things to consider.</p>\n<ol><li><em><strong>How will you fund your scholarship?</strong><br></em>THCF accepts a wide variety of complex assets, from IRAs to farmland; we can help you wade through your options so you can easily establish your scholarship fund. Scholarship funds at THCF should be valued at a minimum of $25,000 and be permanently endowed.</li><li><em><strong>What is the purpose of your scholarship?</strong><br></em>You will want to consider if there is a specific field or level of study you would prefer. You can be as broad or specific as you like, understanding that the more general the requirements, the more students will be eligible to apply for your scholarship. You can also choose if your scholarship will be renewable.</li><li><em><strong>What will be the eligibility criteria for your scholarship?</strong><br></em>You can choose from several eligibility criteria, from class rank and leadership potential to financial need and extra-curricular activities. You determine what type of student is eligible for your scholarship.</li><li><em><strong>How do you want to manage the selection process?</strong><br></em>You can be as involved as you want in the student selection process. Some fundholders allow the THCF Scholarship Committee to review the applications and select their scholarship recipients. In contrast, others establish their own review committees (including a THCF team member) and are engaged in the entire process. How you manage this aspect of your fund is entirely up to you.</li><li><em><strong>What will you name your new scholarship fund?</strong><br></em>This is the best part of the whole set-up process—naming the scholarship. Because scholarships are endowed, your chosen name will live on perpetually. With your newly named scholarship fund set up, you can start using it to make a positive impact on students for years and years to come.</li></ol>\n<p>If you have additional questions about any aspect of setting up a scholarship fund, Rachael Watkins, Director of Scholarships, would be happy to speak with you.

What all community foundations have in common is a long-term commitment to pooling resources from many donors for the betterment of the community. According to the National Philanthropic Trust, grants from Donor Advised Funds at Community Foundations totaled an estimated $9.58 billion in 2021, up 16.5 percent from $8.22 billion granted in 2020. Two reasons people choose a community foundation over other possibilities is because of the multitude of giving options available and the ability of a community foundation to protect the intent of your giving, even after your death. </p>\n<h3>Your Giving Options</h3>\n<p>A community foundation has several options that can both support the causes and organizations close to your heart and help lessen your tax burden. Giving through a donor advised fund is the easiest and most straightforward fund type. However, you can also choose to give to a general unrestricted fund, which allows the foundation the most flexibility to respond to community needs and fund community-focused initiatives. Giving to a field-of-interest fund to address one or more of your giving priorities is another option. This may be a good choice if your interests are broad such as arts and culture, children and youth, or the environment. Or you can get detailed with a designated fund and support a specific charity. No matter how you want to give, your local community foundation most likely has a charitable vehicle to meet your needs. </p>\n<h3><em>Protecting Your Intent</em></h3>\n<p>Giving through a DAF offers the most security for your giving intent. You get to decide what organizations you will grant to and when. Your grant designations are yours alone, and the information on your giving can be private. By creating a letter of instruction, you can also plan how your DAF will be utilized once you are gone. You can direct that it be used to fund a specific organization or a field of interest. You can also name a successor advisor, like your children, for example. And, if your designated organization goes out of business or changes its purpose, the community foundation will move your designated fund to support other organizations with similar missions or programs. It is the community foundation’s responsibility to ensure your intent remains intact.</p>\n<p>Through strategic grantmaking and leadership, community foundations play a crucial role in identifying and solving community problems with help from other community partners. Essentially, they leverage the wealth of yesterday, today, and tomorrow to improve life for those who live, work, and serve in their communities.</p>\n<p>Let us know if you have questions about community foundation funds or what sets a community foundation apart, and how we might help you do more with your giving. Reach out to Cole Eason, our VP of Advancement. He’d be happy to discuss your giving options and protections with you.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

With hundreds of kids participating in a huge fight this month at World of Fun, it’s easy to paint all teens with a single brush -- troublemakers. Yes, some issues need to be addressed. Young people need a positive outlet for their feelings and frustrations. But it’s important to remember that many local teens work diligently to better themselves and their communities. I would like to highlight <em>these</em> local teens.</p>\n<p>For 25 years, Truman Heartland Community Foundation has worked with area high school students through a unique program called Youth Advisory Council (YAC). Through YAC, students from schools throughout the area come together to collaborate and create positive change in the cities where they live. We have valedictorians and gamers, honor society members and theater kids, city kids, and 4-H; they are all pretty amazing young people who are actively doing good.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/YAC/Strike-in-the-Night/_smallBodyImage/20230401_191106.jpg\" alt=\"Strike in the Night Fundraiser\"><figcaption>Strike in the Night Fundraiser</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Just a few weeks ago, YAC members hosted their annual fundraiser. Held on April 1, <em>Strike in the Night – A Fool’s Delight</em> was a cosmic bowling event fit for the whole family. Thanks to an overwhelming response from numerous donors, the event was fully sponsored and raised more than $5,100. The funds raised were added to the Youth Advisory Council Endowment Fund, the proceeds of which the students will distribute back into the community through the grantmaking process later in the year. Last year, YAC provided grant funding to Angel Flight Central, Inc., Giving the Basics, Inc., Marian Hope, and the SE Chapter of Sleep in Heavenly Peace, Inc.<br></p>\n<p>Taking an active role in the Foundation’s grantmaking process is one of our YAC program's most interesting and unique duties. Students visit local nonprofits to learn first-hand about the projects they want to have funded through the Foundation’s Competitive Grants process. Members are encouraged to discuss grant proposals based on everything from the nonprofit’s financial statements to their projected outcomes. The discussions are always so interesting as these students have different perspectives than the adults in the room. There is always a lot of thoughtful dialogue, open communication, and collaboration, though. It may not be a great headline, but I think it is noteworthy.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption left\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/YAC/Fill-the-trucks/_smallBodyImage/20230429_1313000.jpg\" alt=\"YAC Fill Those Trucks\"><figcaption>YAC Students at Fill Those Trucks</figcaption></figure>\n<p>YAC students then turned their attention to their next project, the 9<sup>th</sup> Annual <em>Fill Those Trucks </em>Food Drive. YAC teamed up with our good friends at Hy-Vee again this year and will collect donations at four area Hy-Vee locations this past Saturday, April 29, 2023, from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Students collected donations of non-perishable food items, household cleaners, and personal care products will all be gladly accepted. Community Services League, Lee’s Summit Social Services, and Raytown Emergency Assistance Program will benefit from this year’s effort.</p>\n<p>I am always impressed by our YAC students. They really work at practicing active philanthropy. They give back by volunteering, fundraising, grantmaking, and community service. For 25 years, the Youth Advisory Council has held an essential seat at the Foundation’s decision-making table. I am proud of their contributions and impressed by their accomplishments. I know I will see many of these young people again a few years from now, as they are bound to be the next generation of local community leaders, stakeholders, and philanthropists. </p>\n<p>If you know an area high school Freshman, Sophomore, or Junior that might be interested in our YAC program, please send them our way. They can visit our website at thcf.org/students/youth-advisory-council or contact Diana Castillo, THCF Director of Grants and Donor Services, at castillo@thcf.org or 816-912-4184 for more information. We are always looking to engage new members in this important work. </p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Headshots/Staff/_smallThumbnail/Diana-WEB.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" loading=\"lazy\">\n        <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Have questions about Youth Advisory Council?</h2>      <p>Diana Castillo is here to help!</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:castillo@thcf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Email Diana</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

    "body": "<html><head></head><body>\n    \n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Are you looking for a way to be more philanthropic this year and make the most of your charitable donations? When the federal standard deduction doubled in 2018, many found they no longer qualified for itemization. Since then, many donors have found that utilizing a “bunching” strategy with a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) allows them to continue to support the causes they care about and still get the tax benefits of their charitable giving. </p>\n<p>If your itemized deductions are less than $13,850 for single filers and married filing separately or $27,700 if married filing jointly, you don’t meet the minimum requirements to itemize your federal tax deductions. There is substantial tax savings potential if you can exceed the itemization threshold. Charitable bunching works by bunching together an amount equal to two or three years of your normal charitable donations and contributing it to a DAF. By “bunching” your giving, you will exceed the standard deduction threshold in the year of the donation, and you can continue to give to your usual charities by making grants out of your DAF. </p>\n<p>Here is an example of how this might work. Fred and Wilma Flintstone donate around $9,000 annually to various charities around Bedrock. But even with their state and property tax and mortgage interest deductions, they are still below the $27,700 needed to qualify for a standard deduction. They consult with their professional advisor and decide to bunch three years of their usual giving into one year; in this case, that would be $27,000. They donate the $27,000 to their Donor Advised Fund at the local Community Foundation. Because a DAF is designated for charitable use only, donations made to it are entirely tax-deductible. With the addition of state and property tax and mortgage interest deductions, this tax-wise strategy allows the Flintstones to surpass the standard deduction threshold. They could realize additional deductions of more than $17,000, and the tax savings can be used to increase their support of their favorite causes.</p>\n<p>Charitable bunching is a way for people to be more philanthropic. Although you won’t bunch your giving every year, you can support your favorite organizations and causes even in “off” years through grants from your DAF. With just a few clicks in the online portal or a call to the office, your grants will be on their way.

We all want to be remembered fondly by our friends and loved ones, but how do you create a legacy of philanthropy that lasts for generations? There are plans you can make now, during your lifetime, that can positively impact causes and charities you care about for years and years to come. </p>\n<p>You can add language to several different types of assets so that, upon maturing, they will be used to create an endowed fund (or support an established fund) at Truman Heartland Community Foundation. You can set up a Statement of Intent that instructs THCF of your wish to make a planned gift. The Foundation accepts planned gifts of bequests, IRA or other retirement assets, Charitable Remainder Trusts, life insurance policies, Charitable Gift Annuities, or real estate. </p>\n<p>This gift is so powerful because the donor can choose how the funds will be distributed. Donors can select specific charities to support, set up or support a scholarship fund, and/or allow a successor to decide how donations will be distributed. Donors can also choose to support a Field of Interest Fund, where the funds would be combined with others to create a pool of flexible funding to meet pressing needs in the areas of community enhancement, community action, health and welfare, education, art and humanities, social services, and community-focus. </p>\n<p>When you include Truman Heartland in your planned giving, you are joining an exclusive group of community-focused philanthropists committed to supporting our local communities.

Cash makes up only 7 percent of total wealth in the United States, yet 85 percent of charitable donations are in cash. Stocks, real estate, farm equipment, and other non-cash assets may hold significant potential value for charitable impact.</p>\n<p>Donating non-cash assets may provide multiple benefits while allowing you to support the causes you care about more significantly. Figuring out how to donate non-cash assets can be challenging. Nonprofits often can’t accept assets in their original form. And let’s face it, donors don’t always have the time or expertise to change their assets into easy-to-donate cash. This is where your local Community Foundation can help. Our expertise in complex assets makes us an ideal partner in this kind of philanthropy.</p>\n<p>For instance, contributing appreciated securities held for more than one year can unlock additional funds for charity in two ways. First, by donating stock that has appreciated for more than a year, you are actually giving up to 20 percent more than if you sold the stock and then made a cash donation. The reason is simple: you get to avoid capital gains tax, which may increase the amount available for charity by up to 20 percent. Second, you can claim the fair market value for your charitable deduction if you itemize on your taxes and then have to opportunity to pass on your savings in the form of more charitable giving.</p>\n<p>Although cash is still king in charitable giving, remember that you can do more good when you partner with your Community Foundation to donate non-cash assets. It’s a tax-wise way to increase your philanthropy.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>\n    \n      <div class=\"side-block light\">\n            <div class=\"side-text\">\n            <h2>Interested in Giving?</h2>      <p>Cole Eason is here to help, email or call 816-912-4182.</p>            <div class=\"side-btn text-button\">\n        <p><a href=\"mailto:eason@thcf.org?subject=Interested%20in%20learning%20about%20giving%20through%20THCF\">Email Cole</a></p>\n      </div>\n          </div>\n  </div>",

Monetary donations are straightforward and the simplest way to give, but it doesn't always provide the greatest benefits for donors or impact for charities. Complex assets can be a tax-efficient way to support your favorite charities in a big way.</p>\n<p>Cash equivalent donations are often well understood by donors and nonprofits alike. However, not everyone understands what types of gifts fall under the category of a “complex asset,” and not every nonprofit is able to accept them. Truman Heartland can accept a wide range of non-cash assets, including (but not limited to) appreciated securities, real estate (e.g. farmland), and life insurance.<br></p>\n<p>If you were to sell your appreciated stock, bonds, or mutual funds with the plan of donating the sale amount to charity, you would still be obligated to pay capital gains tax. It would be an amazing gift for any nonprofit to receive, but there could be a substantial tax burden for you. When you donate appreciated securities, you’ve had a while (more than a year) to a Donor Advised Fund or other charitable vehicles; you will be able to claim a federal income tax deduction for the full, appreciated value of the securities. Plus, you will not incur any capital gains tax. It’s a tax-wise option that can make a huge impact on a nonprofit.<br></p>\n<p>Real estate, for example, is another valuable complex asset that can be turned into a donation. Donors who have held on to their property for more than a year can turn their real estate into an extraordinary charitable gift. By donating the property, you can claim a charitable deduction for the fair market value of the real estate. The property can then be sold (or held by the nonprofit) without any impact on your charitable deduction.<br></p>\n<p>You can also use your life insurance policy as a donation by simply naming your favorite charity as the beneficiary of your policy benefits. To do this, just request a “Change of Beneficiary” form from your insurer. This change is revokable, meaning you can change your mind at any point in the future, should your circumstances change. This is a great way to maintain flexibility in your giving; however, there is no income tax deduction for revokable gifts.<br></p>\n<p>You can get income tax benefits if you donate your life insurance during your lifetime. All you have to do is donate the policy to a nonprofit, take the deduction, and, if you are still making payments, you may qualify to deduct your future premium payments, as well. Check with your professional advisor to see what your deduction might look like with this type of strategy. Because life insurance is often very affordable, this is a popular strategy for leaving a sizable gift at a low cost.<br></p>\n<p>Truman Heartland Community Foundation is here to help you do more with your giving. We are happy to discuss your complex asset donation with you and your financial advisor.

Last year grants and scholarship payments from all funds at your Community Foundation totaled $6.3 million, an increase of 7 percent compared to 2021. With some new scholarship funds added, we granted scholarships totaling $740,000, an increase of 38 percent compared to 2021. And our 300 families who have Donor Advised Funds (DAFs) also achieved a new record with grants totaling $3.2 million, an increase of 20 percent compared to 2021.</p>\n<p>The 20 percent increase in grants made from Donor Advised Funds to hundreds of nonprofits in our community is the most gratifying number for me. As you are aware, the stock market in 2022 had one of its worst years, with the S&amp;P 500 down 19.4 percent. The contributions that our Donor Advised Fund families make into their funds are invested in the stock market. So even while they saw the balance in their Donor Advised Fund decline because of the market losses, they continued to generously make grants from their fund to their favorite nonprofits, increasing those grants by 20 percent. While some families may need to decrease their giving in a volatile market, people with Donor Advised Funds have already committed these funds to support charities and continue to make their grants regardless of the market’s ups and downs.<br></p>\n<p>DAFs have gained popularity over the last ten years. In past economic downturns, we have seen declines in giving, and these are the times when charities are usually in the most need of funding. However, as the popularity of DAFs grew over the years, people have begun to realize that having a DAF available when the markets are a bit topsy-turvy can be a real benefit. When you establish a Donor Advised Fund or make a donation into your fund, you receive a tax benefit in that year. Donors can then choose when to pay out those funds; they have complete flexibility in timing.<br></p>\n<p>A DAF allows donors to put money into their fund, grow it over time, and make donations to the charities and causes that are important to them at times that makes sense. Some donors choose to grant only the gains from their DAF to build their DAF to an endowment, creating a legacy for the future. Others choose to issue grants nearly equal to what they put into their DAF each year. When charities need immediate support, DAF fundholders can respond quickly.<br></p>\n<p>DAFs are also flexible in the types of assets that can be contributed. Not every nonprofit is equipped to accept complex assets such as appreciated stock or real estate. By establishing your Donor Advised Fund with your Community Foundation, you can lessen your tax burden and have more money the giveaway to support your favorite charities and causes.<br></p>\n<p>I have now been with Truman Heartland Community Foundation for 13 years. We have seen many changes over those years, but one thing that we can always count on is the generosity of our fundholders and their commitment to making an impact in our community.<br></p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

He was attending the event with his mother, Judge Susan Watkins, to honor the work and memory of their friend Karen DeLuccie, who was awarded Citizen of the Year for Independence. </p>\n<p>You never know what path life will take. We may start on one journey only to change directions to navigate the detours. But when you have the support you need, any path is traversable. When students begin their college journey, they will encounter plenty of bumps in the road. However, with financial assistance from scholarships, the road to higher education can be managed. Thank you to all those donors who support their communities through their <a href=\"https://www.thcf.org/students/scholarships\">Scholarship Funds</a>.</p>\n<h3><em>THCF - What were your college goals when you were in High School?</em></h3>\n<p>Grant – I thought I had it all figured out pretty early. I knew I wanted to have a career in public service, so I planned to attend the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado. I thought I was all set. Everything would be paid for, and I had no real need for additional financial aid. I filled out scholarship applications as a backup before I knew I had been accepted, and I’m glad I did. </p>\n<h3><em>THCF – Why? Did you go to the Academy?</em></h3>\n<p>Grant – I did, but I got an ankle injury and was medically discharged—all of a sudden, I had to switch gears and devise a new plan. I was Valedictorian of my class at Fort Osage, so I knew I had other options. I had always been interested in engineering, so I did my first three years at Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology in Rolla, Missouri. Knowing I had qualified for scholarships was a lifesaver that first semester, and the Foundation staff helped me get everything in place quickly. </p>\n<h3><em>THCF – Did you graduate from Missouri S&amp;T?</em></h3>\n<p>Grant – No. After three years of engineering coursework, I realized it was sapping my energy. I didn’t really enjoy it anymore. I transferred to UMKC and graduated in 2018 with a degree in Economics. I worked throughout college. And thanks to the additional support I received through the Betty McMillin, Edward L. and Linda L. Newlin, Forrest and Marjorie Martin, and the Association for Industrial Development scholarships, I was able to graduate debt-free. </p>\n<h3><em>THCF – What did you do after graduation?</em> </h3>\n<p>Grant – I wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do with my degree when I graduated, except that I wanted to work in public service. My first job was as an intern in the Community Development Department for the City of Independence. From there, I found a job doing contracting, acquisitions, and procurement for the Federal Government: first for the Army Corps of Engineers environmental division, then the US Property and Fiscal Office of California, and since 2021 as a member of a Construction Acquisition Team for the Bureau of Reclamation. Reclamation is best known for managing water supplies in the Western United States, such as the Hoover Dam and California's Central Valley Project.<br></p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

In fact, it's the only thing that ever has.</p>\n            <p class=\"attribution\">- Margaret Mead</p>\n          </blockquote>\n\n      <div class=\"\">\n      <p>In 1982, ten people came together to create something unique in Eastern Jackson County. They wanted to establish an organization that would focus on improving the lives of people living, working, and serving communities throughout the region. Forty years later, Truman Heartland Community Foundation is a vital partner in local philanthropy for more than 800 fundholders. We've come a long way from our humble beginnings and have no intention of slowing down any time soon.<br></p>\n<p>Our fundholders have made enormous contributions to their communities over the years, from supporting education and wildlife conservation to historic preservation and human services. Ten years ago, in 2012, THCF fundholders distributed just over $180,000 to 47 nonprofits through the competitive grant process. During the process, local nonprofits compete for this pool of funds, writing proposals in support of their mission-driven projects. This year, nearly $500,000 was made available through the Jelley Family Foundation Endowment for Children's Education Grant Awards and the Community Grant Awards programs, an increase of 173 percent over ten years ago.</p>\n<p>The people who choose to give through their Community Foundation give to causes for which they care deeply. Some invest in traditional and non-traditional education, helping hundreds of students each year get the education they need to follow their career dreams. Ten years ago, 70 funds provided $172,000 in scholarships to 157 students. In 2022, THCF received a record 1,396 scholarship applications and provided more than $740,000 in scholarships to 300 students.</p>\n<p>For the last 24 years, THCF has engaged area student leaders in local philanthropy through our Youth Advisory Council (YAC). Whether reviewing youth-focused grant applications, raising funds for their endowment, or volunteering in the community, YAC students experience the positive power of philanthropy firsthand. The 2020 pandemic seriously dampened recruitment efforts since most schools needed to utilize remote learning with little or no opportunity for peer-to-peer interactions. Although the group went from 120 student members in 2019 to around 70, they raised $7,000 for their endowment, providing grants to support the mission of Angel Flight Central, Giving the Basics, Marion Hope, and Sleep in Heavenly Peace.</p>\n<p>Our fundholders engage directly with Foundation initiatives, such as YAC. Ten years ago, in addition to youth philanthropy, our focus was on the Community for All Ages initiative. THCF worked with local seniors to help them find volunteer opportunities and ensure needed services were available and accessible. Today, the focus is on assisting hard-working adults to get industry-recognized certifications that lead to good-paying jobs and in-demand careers.</p>\n<p>Job Skills for New Careers is a collaborative initiative that brings together educational institutions, such as the Metropolitan Community Colleges and the University of Central Missouri, funding partners, like Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation and KC Scholars, and Mid-Continent Public Library and Community Services League to provide wrap-around services. The social service aspect is leveraged to improve successful completion rates. With Foundation fundholder support providing more than $200,000 in flexible funding for wrap-around services (such as rental and utility assistance, gas cards, groceries, etc.), people are empowered to build a successful work-life and navigate barriers that prevent them from reaching their long-term goals. In four years, Job Skills for New Careers has helped 345 local adults get the training needed to create financial stability for themselves and their families. </p>\n<p>As with every business, there have been ups and downs over the years. Even though 2012 was a banner year for grants and scholarships, with $4.3 million going out to the community in 2022 total grants and scholarships were $6.3 million, a 46 percent increase. Truman Heartland Community Foundation continues to be a trusted partner in local philanthropy through the support of generous donors, steadfast leadership from our volunteer Board of Directors and local Advisory Boards, and a robust nonprofit community. </p>\n<p>As I look beyond the New Year, I really am about the future. THCF has the privilege of helping people give back to their communities in so many meaningful ways. Fundholders choose to direct their giving to organizations and causes that mean the most to them, and the Foundation works to make it all happen through a simple and seamless process. As we welcome new fundholders into the Foundation family in the coming years, I am excited to see the positive impact their thoughtful gifts will have on individuals, children, and families throughout the region.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",

Students evaluate each organization based on several criteria: what is the community needs to be addressed, do the goals and evaluation plans seem like they will lead to the program’s desired outcomes, does the proposal include a realistic plan for sustainability, how does the project or organization incorporate collaboration, and compare the amount awarded to the number of lives impacted.</p>\n<p>Once the students finish their site visits, they are tasked with creating a professional presentation to share with their fellow YAC members. After reviewing the presentations, members of the 12 schools decide which projects to fund in full, partially, or not at all.

Annie Crawford was recruited to join YAC during her sophomore year at Blue Springs High School.</p>\n    \n        <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Walking\n into her first meeting, she wasn’t sure what to think. Here was this \ngiant group of her peers sitting around tables, chatting, around 100 of \nthem, representing schools from across Eastern Jackson County. It was \nmore than a little intimidating. She could have easily turned around and\n chose not to walk into that room. But she did go in, and without \nknowing it, changed the trajectory of her life. </p>\n<p>As\n a Senior, Annie took on the extra responsibility of being a co-leader \nfor the Blue Springs team. As a Team Leader, she had additional \nexpectations and responsibilities. She ensured her Blue Springs team \nstayed up to date with all the YAC events and fundraisers, attended \nmeetings regularly, and participated in Truman Heartland’s competitive \ngrants process. </p>\n<p>What\n seems to have made the biggest impression on her was the chance to talk\n with nonprofit professionals about their work during the YAC \ncompetitive grant site visits. Each year YAC students tour selected \nnonprofits requesting grant funding for programs serving children and \nyouth. The students tour the facilities and then report what they \nlearned to the Grants Committee. Their reports are taken very seriously \nby their adult partners and directly impact grant allotments. “YAC \nconnected us with organizations that are doing amazing things. We got to\n talk to people that do this incredible work every day. It felt <em>real</em>,” Annie explained. “It was definitely a unique experience, one that most high school students don’t get.” </p>\n<p>Once\n she graduated from high school, Annie went to college at UMKC. Like \nmost college students, her career path changed more than once. She \nfinally landing on a degree in English and graduated in 2018. She \nplanned to take a year or so, work part-time, and travel. She visited \nNew York City, Rocky Mountain National Park, Ireland, and Jordan. She \nwas organizing her next adventure to Peru and looked forward to landing \nher first <em>real</em> job upon her return. Life was going just as planned.</p>\n<p>Enter 2020.</p>\n<p>The\n idea of going to work full-time came to a screeching halt in the Spring\n of 2020. The pandemic raged, and Annie stayed with her mom, waiting, \nlike the rest of us, for life to start again. In this time of limbo, she\n stumbled upon information about AmeriCorps. AmeriCorps VISTA program is\n a national service program designed to alleviate poverty through \nnonprofit capacity building. Vista volunteers work in fundraising, grant\n writing, research, and volunteer recruitment, preparing young adults \nfor a life of service in the public, private, or nonprofit sectors. \nRemembering her time with YAC and the feeling she had listening to all \nthose nonprofit professionals talk about their life-changing work made \nAnnie realize VISTA was the perfect opportunity. </p>\n<p>Annie\n is currently serving at Drumm Farm Center for Children on the Donor \nEngagement team. Drumm Farm helps children build successful lives by \nproviding programs and services that support family environments, \nemotional and physical well-being, educational opportunities, and \npersonal growth. Annie has been busy sending donation acknowledgments, \nassisting on social media, taking pictures, and writing the agency \nnewsletter--gaining valuable professional experience while giving back \nto her community in a meaningful way.</p>\n<p>“It's\n important for young people to feel like they have a voice in their \ncommunity,\" Annie explained. \"We often feel like we are left out of big \nconversations. But with YAC, we have a voice, we get to take an active \nrole in adult conversations, and our voices are heard. It's a pretty \npowerful feeling\". </p>\n<p>Annie\n plans to continue her career in the service of others. She is grateful \nfor all the opportunities Drumm Farm has provided, and she would highly \nrecommend the Americorp VISTA program to others. </p>\n<p>Learn more about the YAC program and how to get a high schooler you know involved at [edit link] <a href=\"http://www.thcf.org/yac\">www.thcf.org/yac</a>. </p>\n    </div>\n\n    </body></html>",
