Over time, the foundation and the communities served grew, achieving regional prominence and serving all of Eastern Jackson County and other contiguous \ncounties. In 1996, the Foundation's name was changed to more accurately \nreflect its Missouri heritage and impact on our current geographic service area.<br></p>\n<p>Today, Truman Heartland Community Foundation serves suburban Eastern Jackson, Cass, and Lafayette Counties with assets of nearly $80 \nmillion and annual grants and scholarships surpassing $5.9 million. A \ntrusted leader in charitable giving, Truman Heartland serves individuals, couples, and families who, through their private giving, wish to support the public good.

People from suburban Eastern Jackson County and beyond came seeking resources to achieve financial stability for themselves and their families. Over the past four years, we are proud to say that nearly 500 individuals benefited from this program.</p>\n<p>The success of the program is attributed to strong collaboration with the Community Services League, KC Scholars, Metropolitan Community Colleges, the University of Central Missouri, and the Mid-Continent Public Library. Community Services League was the leading organization, and its unwavering commitment to providing comprehensive wrap-around services, in addition to high-quality training, was key to the initiative’s success. By offering critical support to help participants navigate life's challenges, CSL employment coaches were able to help them achieve their career goals and build a brighter future.</p>\n<p>We are grateful to all the THCF fundholders who directly supported this community-focused initiative. Their generosity and commitment to helping others is truly inspiring. In 2020, 42 fundholders contributed $120,000 to support Job Skills for New Careers, and this support continued to grow in 2021 and 2022. In the final year, an additional $145,000 was contributed to ensure that all necessary wrap-around services continued to be made available. These donations provided tuition for cohorts of students and offered other life-changing support through CSL, such as utility or rent assistance, transportation vouchers, financial and employment coaching, grocery and gas cards, and more.</p>\n<figure class=\"caption right\"><img src=\"https://stdidthcfprod.blob.core.windows.net/thcf/images/Job-Skills/_smallBodyImage/Wrap-Around-2024.jpg\" alt=\"Wrap around services infographic for 2023\"></figure>\n<p>Thanks to the generous funding provided by the Kauffman Foundation to KC Scholars (now known as Great Jobs KC), this initiative is now well-funded and self-sustaining.

Gifts of cash are fully deductible (up to 50% of your adjusted gross income), for federal tax purposes. If your total gifts exceed this limit, the excess may be carried forward and deducted for an additional five years. Your check must be postmarked or hand delivered by December 31st to qualify for the current year.</p>\n            <p></p>\n          </div>\n                    <button id=\"accordion-open-your-5-gift-options-2\" class=\"accordion__button\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n            Appreciated Stock or Other Securities\n          </button>\n          <div id=\"accordion-section-your-5-gift-options-2\" class=\"accordion__section\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n            <p>\n              </p><p>Gifts of appreciated securities (bonds and stock, including stock in closely held companies) may be used to establish or add to a fund. Such gifts often provide important tax advantages. Their full fair market value is deductible as a charitable contribution up to 30 percent of your adjusted gross income. As with gifts of cash, deduction amounts exceeding this limit may be carried forward for up to five additional years. The added benefit of giving appreciated securities is the avoidance of the capital gains tax on the appreciated portion of the gift. Gifts of closely held stock enjoy the same tax benefits as with publicly traded stock. If you prefer to use depreciated stock as a gift, sell it first and donate the proceeds to maximize your tax benefits.</p>\n            <p></p>\n          </div>\n                    <button id=\"accordion-open-your-5-gift-options-3\" class=\"accordion__button\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n            IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution\n          </button>\n          <div id=\"accordion-section-your-5-gift-options-3\" class=\"accordion__section\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n            <p>\n              </p><p>Seniors 70 ½ years of age and over, can transfer their IRA distribution directly to charity.

Gifts of cash are fully deductible (up to 50% of your adjusted gross income), for federal tax purposes. If your total gifts exceed this limit, the excess may be carried forward and deducted for an additional five years. Your check must be postmarked or hand delivered by December 31st to qualify for the current year.</p>\n            <p></p>\n          </div>\n                    <button id=\"accordion-open-your-5-gift-options-2\" class=\"accordion__button\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n            Appreciated Stock or Other Securities\n          </button>\n          <div id=\"accordion-section-your-5-gift-options-2\" class=\"accordion__section\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n            <p>\n              </p><p>Gifts of appreciated securities (bonds and stock, including stock in closely held companies) may be used to establish or add to a fund.

As with gifts of cash, deduction amounts exceeding this limit may be carried forward for up to five additional years. The added benefit of giving appreciated securities is the avoidance of the capital gains tax on the appreciated portion of the gift. Gifts of closely held stock enjoy the same tax benefits as with publicly traded stock. If you prefer to use depreciated stock as a gift, sell it first and donate the proceeds to maximize your tax benefits.</p>\n            <p></p>\n          </div>\n                    <button id=\"accordion-open-your-5-gift-options-3\" class=\"accordion__button\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n            IRA Qualified Charitable Distribution\n          </button>\n          <div id=\"accordion-section-your-5-gift-options-3\" class=\"accordion__section\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n            <p>\n              </p><p>Seniors 70 ½ years of age and over, can transfer their IRA distribution directly to charity.

You can then work with THCF to determine how the proceeds of your insurance policy can be used for charitable endeavors in your areas of interest.</p>\n            <p></p>\n          </div>\n                    <button id=\"accordion-open-your-5-gift-options-6\" class=\"accordion__button\" aria-expanded=\"false\">\n            Cryptocurrency\n          </button>\n          <div id=\"accordion-section-your-5-gift-options-6\" class=\"accordion__section\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n            <p>\n              </p><p>Donating cryptocurrency to Truman Heartland Community Foundation is a great way to avoid capital gains taxes that you would otherwise realize from your investment.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, you may deduct the fair market value of your cryptocurrency gift on your income tax return.

However, one-time scholarships are also possible through THCF’s scholarship program.</li><li><strong>Scholarship Amount</strong><br>THCF encourages larger scholarship award amounts over smaller awards because the costs of higher education have increased exponentially over the past generation.

These typically include essays on specific prompts, letters of recommendation from specific people in their lives, or proof of participation in specific types of activities relevant to your scholarship.&nbsp;<br><br>The Community Foundation generally encourages utilizing the General Application because it streamlines the application process for students, helps them become eligible for the most scholarship support available to them, and increases candidate pools for the participating scholarships.</p></li><li><strong>Stand-Alone Application</strong><br>This is a standard full scholarship application where the students must complete all questions for each different stand-alone application they wish to apply for (this means filling out their college, field of study, etc., for each and every stand-alone application).

Programs, projects, and general operating grant awards are eligible for funding for up to three consecutive years. All previous grantees and their programs/services had a \"re-set.\" in 2024. 2024 grantees will be in their FIRST year of funding. Grantees will be eligible for two additional years of funding (a new application is needed each year). Once an agency has received grant monies three years in a row, the agency MUST take one year off before reapplying for a grant.</p><h3>Incomplete Applications will Be Disqualified</h3><p>The THCF grants process is very competitive and we want to ensure that each proposal receives fair consideration. We ask that organizations double-check all attachments and ensure that the proposal is completed accurately and submitted before the deadline.&nbsp;</p><p>In the event that an error is identified, Foundation staff may reach out if time allows to help alert you of errors.

Students review at least 16 Community Grant proposals that serve the communities where they live and go to school.&nbsp;</p><p>YAC members conduct site visits to applicant organizations during June and July. The members then share their findings and provide recommendations to THCF's Grants Committee. YAC also uses these site visits to determine how they will award their annual grant dollars from their Endowment fund.&nbsp;<br><br>If your proposal proceeds through the first round of reviews, your agency may be asked if it is willing to host a site visit to discuss your grant proposals with our Youth Advisory Council members.

He firmly believed that hard work, responsibility, honesty, and integrity are the building blocks of a meaningful and purposeful life.</p><p>Dr. Jelley was deeply devoted to helping all children and youth, regardless of demographics, reach their full potential. The endowment established in his name continues to exemplify Dr. Jelley’s dedication to children’s education.

Proposals that take an innovative approach to education, focus on at-risk youth, and are collaborative with other organizations are encouraged.</li><li>Organizations must be 501(c)(3) nonprofits, units of local government, or public education institutions</li><li>Must be located in or serving individuals or communities in Eastern Jackson County (East of I-435), Missouri, suburban Jackson County (outside KC), and Cass County</li><li>With EDUCATION proposals due in March, it is recommended that your project has a start date of August/September when school starts OR begin in January of the following year.</li></ul><h3>3-Year Rule</h3><p>Beginning in 2024, a 3-year rule was implemented. Programs, projects, and general operating grant awards are eligible for funding for up to three consecutive years. All previous grantees and their programs/services had a \"re-set.\" in 2024. 2024 grantees will be in their FIRST year of funding. Grantees will be eligible for two additional years of funding (a new application is needed each year). Once an agency has received grant monies three years in a row, the agency MUST take one year off before reapplying for a grant.</p><h3>Apply For Just One Grant</h3><p>As of 2024, eligible organizations may apply for ONLY ONE grant, either through Community Grants OR the Jelley Family Foundation Grants.&nbsp;</p><h3>Incomplete Applications will Be Disqualified</h3><p>The THCF grants process is very competitive and we want to ensure that each proposal receives fair consideration.

Blair had noticed many foster children arrived without socks of their own, and she was determined to make a difference.</p><p>Just weeks after dreaming up this idea, Blair’s young life was tragically cut short on July 4, 2011, when she was struck and killed by a stray bullet from celebratory gunfire. In the face of unimaginable loss, Michele turned her grief into action. She brought her daughter’s vision to life, founding <strong>Blair’s Foster Socks</strong>, a nonprofit that has since served thousands of vulnerable children locally, nationally, and internationally with comfort, hope, and tangible care.</p>\n    </div>\n\n      <div class=\"embed video\">\n            <div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1120942333?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" title=\"2025_Michele Shanahan DeMoss\" data-ready=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"\">\n      <p>Driven by her daughter’s memory and mission, Michele also became a tireless advocate for public safety. For 14 years, she fought to pass <strong>Blair’s Law</strong>, which criminalizes the reckless discharge of firearms within city limits. Her unwavering determination led to its passage in the Missouri General Assembly in 2024—turning her advocacy into lasting policy that will protect countless lives for years to come.</p><p>In addition to her nonprofit work and advocacy, Michele founded <strong>Under the Awning</strong>, a charming gift boutique near Independence Square, where every product sold supports charitable causes. It’s another reflection of her unique ability to pair entrepreneurship with benevolence, creating everyday ways for people to give back.</p><p>Michele also helped establish the <strong>Blair Michaela Shanahan Lane Memorial Scholarship Fund</strong> at Truman Heartland Community Foundation, supporting high school students from across the region who have persevered through hardship.</p><p>Throughout her journey, Michele has become a sought-after speaker and community voice, advocating for organ donation, public safety, and hope in the face of adversity. She has never stopped giving—whether through socks, scholarships, legislation, or love. Her life is a testament to the power of one woman’s courage to turn pain into purpose, and to ensure that her daughter’s light continues to shine across the world.</p>\n    </div>",

difference. They volunteer their time to collect nonperishable food and household items at four area Hy-Vee locations. Their goal? Supporting three area food pantries and helping to feed those in need within the community. It's a heartwarming demonstration of generosity and kindness that truly makes a difference in people's lives. </p>\n\n      <div class=\"photo-gallery\">\n      <div class=\"slightbox-container\">\n
